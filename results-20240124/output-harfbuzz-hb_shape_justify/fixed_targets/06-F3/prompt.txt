Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <hb.h>
#include <hb-ot.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "hb-ot-color.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  hb_font_t *font = hb_font_create();
  hb_buffer_t *buffer = hb_buffer_create();
  hb_glyph_extents_t features;
  int num_features = 0;
  char **shaper_list = NULL;
  float min_target_advance = 0.0f;
  float max_target_advance = 0.0f;
  float *advance = NULL;
  int *var_tag = NULL;
  float *var_value = NULL;

  hb_shape_justify(font, buffer, &features, num_features, shaper_list, min_target_advance, max_target_advance, advance, var_tag, var_value);

  hb_font_destroy(font);
  hb_buffer_destroy(buffer);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
