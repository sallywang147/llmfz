Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string.h>

#include <krb5.h>
#include <gssapi.h>
#include "gss_ntlmssp.h"

extern "C" {
#include <ntlm.h>
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size)
{
    OM_uint32 maj_stat, min_stat;

    struct gssntlm_ctx ctx;
    struct gssntlm_cred cred;
    struct ntlm_buffer target_info = { 0 };

    memset(&ctx, 0, sizeof(ctx));
    memset(&cred, 0, sizeof(cred));

    maj_stat = gssntlm_cli_auth(
        &min_stat,
        &ctx,
        &cred,
        &target_info,
        0, /* in_flags */
        NULL /* input_chan_bindings */
    );

    gssntlm_ctx_free(&ctx);
    gssntlm_cred_free(&cred);

    return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
