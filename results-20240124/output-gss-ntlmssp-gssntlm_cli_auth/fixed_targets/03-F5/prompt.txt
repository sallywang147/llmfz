Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "gssntlm.h"
#include <stddef.h>

extern "C" {
#include <gssapi/gssapi.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  gssntlm_ctx *ctx = gssntlm_alloc_ctx();
  struct gssntlm_cred *cred = NULL;
  struct ntlm_buffer *target_info = NULL;
  int in_flags = 0;
  struct gss_channel_bindings_struct *input_chan_bindings = NULL;
  int minor_status;

  gssntlm_cli_auth(&minor_status, ctx, cred, target_info, in_flags, input_chan_bindings);

  gssntlm_free_ctx(ctx);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
