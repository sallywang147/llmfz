Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <gssntlm.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ntlm.h>
}

int main() {
  gssntlm_ctx_handle_t ctx = nullptr;
  gssntlm_cred_handle_t cred = nullptr;

  // Initialize the NTLM context
  gssntlm_init_ctx(&ctx);

  // Initialize the NTLM credentials
  gssntlm_init_cred(&cred);

  // Perform NTLM client authentication
  gssntlm_cli_auth(ctx, cred);

  // Free the NTLM context
  gssntlm_free_ctx(ctx);

  // Free the NTLM credentials
  gssntlm_free_cred(cred);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
