Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "fuzzing/datasource/datasource.hpp"
#include "fuzzing/types/container.hpp"

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  fuzzing::datasource::Datasource ds(data, size);
  fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> container;
  try {
    ds.Get<fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> >(&container, nullptr, 0);
  } catch ( ... ) { }
  return 0;
}
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> fuzzing::datasource::Base::Get<fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> >(fuzzing::types::Container * this, std::exception * id, size_t )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> fuzzing::datasource::Base::Get<fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> >(fuzzing::types::Container * this, std::exception * id, size_t )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
