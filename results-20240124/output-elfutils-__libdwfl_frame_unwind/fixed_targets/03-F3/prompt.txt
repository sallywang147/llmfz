Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <libunwind.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libdwfl.h>
}

int main() {
  unw_context_t uc;
  unw_getcontext(&uc);
  unw_cursor_t cursor;
  unw_init_local(&cursor, &uc);
  int i = 0;
  while (unw_step(&cursor) > 0) {
    Dl_info info;
    int ret = dladdr(unw_get_reg(&cursor, UNW_REG_IP), &info);
    if (ret == 0) {
      printf("failed to get dladdr\n");
      continue;
    }
    printf("%d: %s\n", i++, info.dli_sname);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
