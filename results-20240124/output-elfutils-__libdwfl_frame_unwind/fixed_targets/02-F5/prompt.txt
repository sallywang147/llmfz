Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <execinfo.h>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include <libdwarf.h>
#include <libdwarf/dwarf.h>
}

int main() {
  void *handle = dlopen("libdwarf.so", RTLD_NOW);
  if (handle == nullptr) {
    std::cerr << "Failed to load libdwarf.so" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  Dwarf_Debug dbg = dwarf_begin(handle, DWARF_C_READ, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (dbg == nullptr) {
    std::cerr << "Failed to initialize libdwarf" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // ... use libdwarf ...

  dwarf_end(dbg);
  dlclose(handle);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
