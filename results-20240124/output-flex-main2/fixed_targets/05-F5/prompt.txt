Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t arg_count = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10);
  std::vector<std::string> args;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < arg_count; ++i) {
    args.push_back(stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100)));
  }
  main2(arg_count, args.data());
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/fuzz-main.c:1:10: fatal error: 'cstddef' file not found
#include <cstddef>
         ^~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
