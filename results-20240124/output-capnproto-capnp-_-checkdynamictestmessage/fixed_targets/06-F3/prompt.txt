Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <capnp/message.h>
#include <capnp/serialize.h>
#include <capnp/serialize-packed.h>
#include <capnp/dynamic.h>
#include <capnp/test.capnp.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "check_test_message.h"
}

void LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  capnp::DynamicStruct::Builder builder;
  capnp::_::checkDynamicTestMessage(&builder);
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);
  capnp::writePackedMessage(builder, fuzzed_data.ConsumeBytes(size));
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
