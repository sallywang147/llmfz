Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "cups.h"
#include "ipp.h"
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <algorithm>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string resource = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  http_t *http = httpNew();
  ipp_t *request = ippNew();
  cupsDoRequest(http, request, resource.c_str());
  httpDelete(http);
  ippDelete(request);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/usr/local/lib/clang/15.0.0/include/fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h:16:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>

./../cups/http.h:429:13: note: candidate function not viable: requires 2 arguments, but 1 was provided

                        ^
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
