Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"
#include "ssh.h"
#include "ssh2.h"

extern "C" void recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok(ssh2_session *session, ssh2_message *message) {
  (void) session;
  (void) message;
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  ssh2_userauth_pk_ok(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes());
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
