Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "FLAC++/metadata.h"
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int FLAC__metadata_chain_read_with_callbacks(struct FLAC__Metadata_Chain * chain, char * handle, struct FLAC__IOCallbacks * callbacks)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int FLAC__metadata_chain_read_with_callbacks(struct FLAC__Metadata_Chain * chain, char * handle, struct FLAC__IOCallbacks * callbacks)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
