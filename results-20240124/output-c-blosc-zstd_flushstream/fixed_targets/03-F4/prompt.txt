Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <zstd.h>
#include <stddef.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ZSTD_CCtx *cctx = ZSTD_createCCtx();
  ZSTD_inBuffer input = {data, size, 0};
  ZSTD_outBuffer output = {NULL, 0, 0};
  size_t ret;

  while ((ret = ZSTD_compressStream(cctx, &output, &input)) > 0) {
    // Do something with the compressed data in output.pos
  }
  ZSTD_flushStream(cctx, &output);

  ZSTD_freeCCtx(cctx);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
