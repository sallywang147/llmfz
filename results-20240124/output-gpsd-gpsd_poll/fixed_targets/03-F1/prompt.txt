Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include "gpsd.h"

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 9216

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
    if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
        return 0;
    }

    {
        struct gps_device_t device;
        int nullfd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);
        ssize_t st;

        gps_init(&device, WATCH_ENABLE | WATCH_JSON);
        device.errout.debug = 0;

        memcpy(device.inbufptr = device.inbuffer, Data, Size);
        device.inbuflen = Size;

        do {
            st = gpsd_poll(&device);
        } while (st > 0);

        close(nullfd);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
