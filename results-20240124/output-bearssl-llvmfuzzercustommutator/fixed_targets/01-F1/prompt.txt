Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char *data, size_t size, size_t max_size, int seed) {
  // Use the seed to initialize the random number generator.
  srand(seed);

  // Generate a random number between 0 and max_size.
  size_t new_size = rand() % (max_size + 1);

  // If the new size is smaller than the original size, then we need to
  // truncate the data.
  if (new_size < size) {
    data[new_size] = '\0';
  }
  // If the new size is larger than the original size, then we need to
  // pad the data with random bytes.
  else if (new_size > size) {
    for (size_t i = size; i < new_size; i++) {
      data[i] = rand() % 256;
    }
  }

  // Return the new size of the data.
  return new_size;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
