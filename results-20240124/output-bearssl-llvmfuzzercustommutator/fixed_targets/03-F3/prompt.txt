Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutate.h"
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char *data, size_t size, size_t max_size, int seed) {
  // Do some fuzzing here
  // ...

  // Call the function to be fuzzed
  size_t ret = LLVMFuzzerMutate(data, size, max_size, seed);

  // Do some more fuzzing here
  // ...

  return ret;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
