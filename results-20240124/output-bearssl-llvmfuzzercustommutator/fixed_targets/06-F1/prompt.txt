Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char *Data, size_t Size,
                                           size_t MaxSize, int Seed) {
  // Do something with Data, Size, MaxSize, and Seed.
  // Here we just copy the input data to the output.
  if (Size > MaxSize) {
    Size = MaxSize;
  }
  memcpy(Data, Data, Size);
  return Size;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
