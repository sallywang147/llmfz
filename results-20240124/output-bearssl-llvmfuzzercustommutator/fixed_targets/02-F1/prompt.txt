Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char *data, size_t size,
                                         size_t max_size, int seed) {
  // Your custom mutator logic goes here.
  // For example, you can use the following code to randomly flip bits in the input:
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (rand() % 2 == 0) {
      data[i] ^= 1;
    }
  }

  // Return the new size of the input.
  return size;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
