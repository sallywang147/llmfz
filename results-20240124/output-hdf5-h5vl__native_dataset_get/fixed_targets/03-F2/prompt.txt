Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "hdf5.h"

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *path = (char *)data;
  size_t path_len = size;

  struct H5VL_dataset_get_args_t args;
  memset(&args, 0, sizeof(args));
  args.path = path;
  args.path_len = path_len;

  char *buf = nullptr;
  size_t buf_len = 0;
  int ret = H5VL__native_dataset_get(path, &args, buf_len, &buf);
  if (ret == 0) {
    free(buf);
  }
  return 0;
}
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/h5_read_fuzzer.c:7:8: error: expected identifier or '('
extern "C" {
       ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
