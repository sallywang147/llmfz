Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <H5Cpp.h>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include <H5VL.h>
}

using namespace H5;

int main() {
  try {
    H5File file("test.h5", H5F_ACC_RDONLY);
    DataSet dataset = file.openDataSet("dataset");

    // Get the native dataset handle
    hid_t native_dataset_id = H5VL__native_dataset_get(dataset.getId());

    // Do something with the native dataset handle...

    // Close the dataset and file
    dataset.close();
    file.close();
  } catch (Exception &e) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.getDetailMessage() << std::endl;
    return -1;
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
