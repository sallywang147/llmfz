Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  anon f;
  double a = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double b = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double epsilon = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double min_y = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double max_y = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double ya;
  double yb;
  double y;
  double result = solve_itp<hb_shape_justify::$_3>(&f, a, b, epsilon, min_y, max_y, &ya, &yb, &y);
  printf("result: %f\n", result);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `double solve_itp<hb_shape_justify::$_3>(anon * f, double a, double b, double epsilon, double min_y, double max_y, double * ya, double * yb, double * y)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `double solve_itp<hb_shape_justify::$_3>(anon * f, double a, double b, double epsilon, double min_y, double max_y, double * ya, double * yb, double * y)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
