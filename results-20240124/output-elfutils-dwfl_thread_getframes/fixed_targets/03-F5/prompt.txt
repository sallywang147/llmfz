Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "libdwarf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const char* thread_name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  Dwfl_Thread thread;
  dwfl_thread_init(&thread, thread_name, nullptr);
  dwfl_thread_getframes(&thread, nullptr, nullptr);
  dwfl_thread_fini(&thread);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/fuzz-libdwfl.c:1:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
