Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <algorithm>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "command.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::vector<std::string> args;
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    args.push_back(stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString());
  }
  command_param param = {.args = args};
  command_environ cenv = {};
  recover_handler(&param, &cenv);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/usr/local/lib/clang/15.0.0/include/fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h:16:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

Fix failure
gdbm_fuzzer.cpp:10:10: fatal error: 'command.h' file not found
#include "command.h"
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
