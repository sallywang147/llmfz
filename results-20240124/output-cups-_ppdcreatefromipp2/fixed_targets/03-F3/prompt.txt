Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_cupsFileClose", referenced from:
      _LoadIPP in fuzzipp.o
  "_cupsFileOpen", referenced from:
      _LoadIPP in fuzzipp.o
  "_cupsFileRead", referenced from:
      _ippReadIO in fuzzipp.o
  "_ippDelete", referenced from:
      _LoadIPP in fuzzipp.o
  "_ippNew", referenced from:
      _LoadIPP in fuzzipp.o
  "_ippReadIO", referenced from:
      _LoadIPP in fuzzipp.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `char * _ppdCreateFromIPP2(char * buffer, size_t bufsize, struct _ipp_s * supported, struct cups_lang_s * lang)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `char * _ppdCreateFromIPP2(char * buffer, size_t bufsize, struct _ipp_s * supported, struct cups_lang_s * lang)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
