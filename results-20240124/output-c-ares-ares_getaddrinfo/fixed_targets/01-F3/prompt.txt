Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>

#include "ares.h"

extern "C" {
#include "ares_setup.h"
}

// Entrypoint for Clang's libfuzzer
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data,
                                     unsigned long size) {
  // Feed the data into ares_getaddrinfo.
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
  ares_init(&channel);
  ares_getaddrinfo(&channel, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  ares_destroy(&channel);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
