Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <stddef.h>

#include "ares.h"

// Entrypoint for Clang's libfuzzer
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data,
                           unsigned long size) {
  // Feed the data into ares_getaddrinfo.
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
  ares_init(&channel);
  ares_getaddrinfo(&channel, (char *)data, (char *)data, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  ares_destroy(&channel);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/c-ares/test/ares-test-fuzz-name.c:9:27: error: variable has incomplete type 'struct ares_channeldata'
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
                          ^
include/ares.h:342:8: note: forward declaration of 'struct ares_channeldata'
struct ares_channeldata;
       ^
1 error generated.

Fix failure
/src/c-ares/test/ares-test-fuzz-name.cpp:9:27: error: variable has incomplete type 'struct ares_channeldata'
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
                          ^
include/ares.h:342:8: note: forward declaration of 'ares_channeldata'
struct ares_channeldata;
       ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
