Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cryptofuzz/Builtin_tests_importer.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Initialize();
    initialized = true;
  }

  std::vector<uint8_t> input_buffer(data, data + size);
  cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Run((union.anon*)input_buffer.data());
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
