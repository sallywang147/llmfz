Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "signkey.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }

  int keytype = data[0];
  int bits = data[1];
  char filename[256];
  snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "/tmp/signkey_fuzz_%d_%d", keytype, bits);
  int skip_exist = data[2];

  signkey_generate(keytype, bits, filename, skip_exist);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
