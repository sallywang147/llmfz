Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <brunsli/brunsli_decode.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  brunsli::BrunsliDecoder decoder;
  size_t available_in = size;
  const uint8_t* next_in = data;
  size_t available_out = 0;
  uint8_t* next_out = nullptr;
  char* out_data = nullptr;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  decoder.Decode(&available_in, &next_in, &available_out, &next_out, &out_data);

  free(out_data);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
c/tests/fuzz_decode_streaming.cc:13:70: error: too many arguments to function call, expected 4, have 5
  decoder.Decode(&available_in, &next_in, &available_out, &next_out, &out_data);
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     ^~~~~~~~~
./c/include/brunsli/brunsli_decode.h:55:10: note: 'Decode' declared here
  Status Decode(size_t* available_in, const uint8_t** next_in,
         ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
