Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstddef>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "libprotobuf-mutator/src/libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h"
#include "gifProtoFuzzer.pb.h"

using namespace gifProtoFuzzer;

extern "C" {
#include <google/protobuf/message_lite.h>
}

DEFINE_PROTO_FUZZER(const BasicChunk &chunk) {
  BasicChunk *new_chunk = BasicChunk::CreateMaybeMessage<BasicChunk>(nullptr, &chunk);
  delete new_chunk;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk * gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk* google::protobuf::MessageLite::CreateMaybeMessage<gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk>(google::protobuf::Arena * arena, gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk * from)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk * gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk* google::protobuf::MessageLite::CreateMaybeMessage<gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk>(google::protobuf::Arena * arena, gifProtoFuzzer::BasicChunk * from)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
