Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include "fuzzing/types/container.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  fuzzing::types::Container<unsigned char, false, false> container(data, size);
  container.~Container();
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
encoder.cpp:13:17: error: cannot initialize a variable of type 'const char *' with an rvalue of type 'char'
    const char *value = ds.Get<char>();

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
