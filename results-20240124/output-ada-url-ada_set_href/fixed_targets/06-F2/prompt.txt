Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "ada.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t input_length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  const std::string input_string = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(input_length);
  const size_t result_length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  char result[result_length];
  if (!ada_set_href(result, const_cast<char*>(input_string.c_str()), input_length)) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
