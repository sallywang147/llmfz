Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "Tpm.h"

extern "C" {
#include "TpmTypes.h"
#include "CreateLoaded_fp.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  if (Data == NULL || Size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct CreateLoaded_In in;
  struct CreateLoaded_Out out;

  if (TPM2_CreateLoaded(&in, &out) != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
fuzzer.cc:16:10: error: typedef 'CreateLoaded_In' cannot be referenced with a struct specifier
  struct CreateLoaded_In in;
         ^
./CreateLoaded_fp.h:71:3: note: declared here
} CreateLoaded_In;
  ^
fuzzer.cc:17:10: error: typedef 'CreateLoaded_Out' cannot be referenced with a struct specifier
  struct CreateLoaded_Out out;
         ^
./CreateLoaded_fp.h:82:3: note: declared here
} CreateLoaded_Out;
  ^
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
