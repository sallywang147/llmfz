Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <gdbm-ndbm.h>
extern "C" {
#include <gdbm/ndbm.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct dump_file file;
  struct gdbm_file_info dbf;
  struct gdbm_file_info *ofp;
  int replace = 0;
  int meta_mask = 0;
  _gdbm_load_file(&file, &dbf, &ofp, replace, meta_mask);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
