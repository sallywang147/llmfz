Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "gdbm.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int replace = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int meta_mask = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct dump_file file;
  struct gdbm_file_info dbf;
  struct gdbm_file_info* ofp = nullptr;

  _gdbm_load_file(&file, &dbf, &ofp, replace, meta_mask);

  _gdbm_close_file(&file);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
