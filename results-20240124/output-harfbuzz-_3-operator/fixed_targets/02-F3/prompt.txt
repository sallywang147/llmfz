Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <hb.h>
#include <hb-ot.h>
#include <hb-ft.h>

extern "C" {
#include <hb-shape.h>
}

int main() {
  hb_font_t *font = hb_font_create();
  hb_buffer_t *buffer = hb_buffer_create();
  hb_shape(font, buffer, nullptr, 0);
  hb_font_destroy(font);
  hb_buffer_destroy(buffer);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `double hb_shape_justify::$_3::operator(anon * this, double x) const` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `double hb_shape_justify::$_3::operator(anon * this, double x) const` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
