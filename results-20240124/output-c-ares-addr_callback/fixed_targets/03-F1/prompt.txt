Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <stddef.h>

#include "ares.h"

// Entrypoint for Clang's libfuzzer
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data,
                           unsigned long size) {
  struct ares_addrttl info[5];
  int count = 5;
  ares_parse_a_reply(data, size, NULL, info, &count);

  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    addr_callback(info[i].ipaddr, sizeof(info[i].ipaddr), AF_INET, NULL, 0);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
ares-test-fuzz-name.c:(.text.LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput[LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput]+0x166): undefined reference to `addr_callback'
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
