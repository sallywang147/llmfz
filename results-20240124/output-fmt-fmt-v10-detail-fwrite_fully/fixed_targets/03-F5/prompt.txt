Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "fmt/format.h"
#include "fmt/core.h" // Include the header for fwrite_fully

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    fmt::print("Initializing\n");
    initialized = true;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t count = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::string text = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  std::vector<char> buffer(count);
  fmt::fwrite_fully(buffer.data(), count, stdout); // Use fwrite_fully instead
  fmt::print("Wrote {} bytes\n", count);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/fmt/test/fuzzing/chrono-timepoint.cc:24:8: error: no member named 'fwrite_fully' in namespace 'fmt'
  fmt::fwrite_fully(buffer.data(), count, stdout); // Use fwrite_fully instead
  ~~~~~^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
