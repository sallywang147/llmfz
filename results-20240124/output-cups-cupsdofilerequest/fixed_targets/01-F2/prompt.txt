Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
FuzzIPP.c:1:6: error: expected ';' after top level declarator
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
     ^
     ;
FuzzIPP.c:1:8: error: unknown type name 'undefined'
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
       ^
FuzzIPP.c:1:27: error: expected ';' after top level declarator
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
                          ^
                          ;
3 errors generated.

Fix failure
FuzzIPP.cpp:1:1: error: unknown type name 'error'
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
^
FuzzIPP.cpp:1:6: error: expected unqualified-id
error: undefined reference to 'cupsDoFileRequest'
     ^
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
