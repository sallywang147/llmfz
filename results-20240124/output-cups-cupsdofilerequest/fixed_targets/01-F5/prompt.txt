Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cups/http.h>
#include <cups/ipp.h>
}

int main() {
    http_t *http = httpConnectEncrypt(AF_UNSPEC, "localhost", 631);
    cupsDoFileRequest(http, NULL, "/jobs", "GET", NULL, 0, NULL);
    httpClose(http);
    return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
