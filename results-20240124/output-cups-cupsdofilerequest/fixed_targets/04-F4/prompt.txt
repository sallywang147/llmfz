Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cups/cups.h>
}

int main() {
  cupsDoFileRequest(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
FuzzIPP.cpp:(.text.main[main]+0x0): multiple definition of `main'; /usr/bin/ld: DWARF error: invalid or unhandled FORM value: 0x25
(.text.main+0x12): undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
