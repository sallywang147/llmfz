Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "flexdef.h"
#include "scanopt.h"

extern "C" {
#include "FlexLexer.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  void *xmalloc_fuzz = malloc(size);
  memcpy(xmalloc_fuzz, data, size);
  int size_fuzz = *(int *)xmalloc_fuzz;
  free(xmalloc_fuzz);
  void *ret = yy_flex_xmalloc(size_fuzz);
  free(ret);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
