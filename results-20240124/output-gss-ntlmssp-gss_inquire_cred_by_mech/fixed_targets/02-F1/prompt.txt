Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int minor_status;
  gss_cred_id_struct cred_handle;
  gss_OID_desc_struct mech_type;
  gss_name_struct *name;
  int initiator_lifetime;
  int acceptor_lifetime;
  int cred_usage;
  gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(&minor_status, &cred_handle, &mech_type, &name,
                           &initiator_lifetime, &acceptor_lifetime, &cred_usage);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/usr/local/lib/clang/15.0.0/include/fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h:16:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

Fix failure
fuzz-accept-sec-context.cpp:7:22: error: variable has incomplete type 'gss_cred_id_struct'
  gss_cred_id_struct cred_handle;
                     ^
/usr/include/gssapi/gssapi.h:81:8: note: forward declaration of 'gss_cred_id_struct'
struct gss_cred_id_struct;
       ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
