Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <mc/MCInst.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t handle = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t ByteLen = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t Address = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<uint8_t> Bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(ByteLen);
  MCInst MI;
  short Size;
  std::string Info = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  TriCore_getInstruction(handle, Bytes.data(), ByteLen, &MI, &Size, Address,
                         Info.c_str());
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/capstonev5/suite/fuzz/fuzz_disasm.c:1:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
