Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
// Fix: wrap the #include directive with extern "C" {}.
extern "C" {
#include "flatbuffers/idl.h"
}

// Fix: add the missing function declaration.
extern "C" char * char const* flatbuffers::JsonPrinter::PrintVector<flatbuffers::Offset64<void>, unsigned int>(struct flatbuffers::JsonPrinter * , char * , struct flatbuffers::Type * , int , char * );

// The original LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput function.
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // Call the missing function.
  flatbuffers::JsonPrinter::PrintVector<flatbuffers::Offset64<void>, unsigned int>(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, 0, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `char * char const* flatbuffers::JsonPrinter::PrintVector<flatbuffers::Offset64<void>, unsigned int>(struct flatbuffers::JsonPrinter * , char * , struct flatbuffers::Type * , int , char * )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `char * char const* flatbuffers::JsonPrinter::PrintVector<flatbuffers::Offset64<void>, unsigned int>(struct flatbuffers::JsonPrinter * , char * , struct flatbuffers::Type * , int , char * )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
