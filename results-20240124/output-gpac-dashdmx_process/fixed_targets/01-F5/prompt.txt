Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <gpac/filters.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <algorithm>

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct __gf_filter *filter = gf_filter_create();
  gf_filter_set_input(filter, (u8 *)data, size);
  gf_filter_process(filter);
  gf_filter_delete(filter);
  return 0;
}
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int dashdmx_process(struct __gf_filter * filter)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int dashdmx_process(struct __gf_filter * filter)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
