Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <libssh/libssh.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libssh/server.h>
}

int main(void) {
  ssh_session session = ssh_new();
  if (session == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error creating session\n");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");
  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_PORT, 22);

  if (ssh_connect(session)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error connecting to host\n");
    ssh_free(session);
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  if (svr_ensure_hostkey(session)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error ensuring host key\n");
    ssh_disconnect(session);
    ssh_free(session);
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  ssh_disconnect(session);
  ssh_free(session);

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
