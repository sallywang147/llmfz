Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fmt/core.h>

#include <cstdint>

#include "fuzzer-common.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  // Always use a fixed location of the data.
  static_assert(sizeof(uint64_t) <= fixed_size, "fixed size is too small");
  if (size <= fixed_size + 1) return 0;

  const uint64_t args = assign_from_buf<uint64_t>(data);
  data += fixed_size;
  size -= fixed_size;

  // data is already allocated separately in libFuzzer so reading past the end
  // will most likely be detected anyway.
  const auto format_str = fmt::string_view(as_chars(data), size);

  fmt::vprintln(stdout, format_str, fmt::arg(args));
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/fmt/test/fuzzing/chrono-timepoint.cc:20:37: error: no matching function for call to 'arg'
  fmt::vprintln(stdout, format_str, fmt::arg(args));
                                    ^~~~~~~~
/src/fmt/include/fmt/base.h:2005:13: note: candidate function template not viable: requires 2 arguments, but 1 was provided
inline auto arg(const Char* name, const T& arg) -> detail::named_arg<Char, T> {
            ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
