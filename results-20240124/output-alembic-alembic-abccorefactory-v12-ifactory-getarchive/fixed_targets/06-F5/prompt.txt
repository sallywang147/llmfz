Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <Alembic/AbcCoreFactory/v12/IFactory.h>
#include <Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v1/Ogawa.h>
#include <Alembic/AbcGeom/v1/All.h>
#include <Alembic/AbcMaterial/v1/All.h>

extern "C" {
#include <Alembic/AbcCoreFactory/v1/IFactory.h>
}

void LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive archive;
  Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory factory;
  std::vector<Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory::CoreType> types;
  factory.getArchive(&archive, &factory, &types);
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/alembic_dump_info_fuzzer.cc:1:10: fatal error: 'Alembic/AbcCoreFactory/v12/IFactory.h' file not found
#include <Alembic/AbcCoreFactory/v12/IFactory.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
