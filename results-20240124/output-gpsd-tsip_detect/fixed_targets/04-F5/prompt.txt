Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "gpsd_config.h"  /* must be before all includes */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include "gpsd.h"

extern "C" {
#include "gps.h"
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size)
{
    if (Size < 10 || Size > 10000) {
        return 0;
    }

    {
        struct gps_device_t device;

        device.lexer.errout.debug = 0;

        memcpy(device.lexer.inbufptr = device.lexer.inbuffer, Data, Size);
        device.lexer.inbuflen = Size;

        tsip_detect(&device);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
FuzzJson.c:10:8: error: expected identifier or '('
extern "C" {
       ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
