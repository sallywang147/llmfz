Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "astc_codec_internals.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const int xdim = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int ydim = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  is_legal_2d_block_size(xdim, ydim);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
./Fuzzers/fuzz_astc_physical_to_symbolic.cpp:7:10: fatal error: 'astc_codec_internals.h' file not found
#include "astc_codec_internals.h"
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
