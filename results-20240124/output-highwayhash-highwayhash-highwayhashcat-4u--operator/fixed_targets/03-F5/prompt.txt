Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_hh_sip_128.h>
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_hh_sip_256.h>

extern "C" {
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_hh_sip_128.h>
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_hh_sip_256.h>
}

int main() {
  highwayhash::HHKey key128;
  highwayhash::HHKey key256;
  highwayhash::StringView str;
  highwayhash::HHResult64 result128;
  highwayhash::HHResult64 result256;
  highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<4u>()(key128, key256, &str, 10, &result128);
  highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<8u>()(key128, key256, &str, 10, &result256);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<4u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, size_t * hash) const` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<4u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, size_t * hash) const` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
