Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Create a vector of integers
  vector<int> numbers;

  // Add some numbers to the vector
  numbers.push_back(1);
  numbers.push_back(2);
  numbers.push_back(3);

  // Print the numbers in the vector
  for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    cout << numbers[i] << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void __cxx_global_var_init()` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void __cxx_global_var_init()` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
