Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include <hb.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

int main() {
  hb_document_t *doc = hb_document_create();
  hb_face_t *face = hb_face_create("Roboto-Regular.ttf", 0);
  hb_font_t *font = hb_font_create(face);
  hb_subset_preprocess(font);
  hb_font_destroy(font);
  hb_face_destroy(face);
  hb_document_destroy(doc);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
