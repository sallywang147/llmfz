Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  char arg[1000];
  size_t spec = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  int out = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  absl::str_format_internal::FormatArgImpl::Dispatch<signed char>(arg, spec, out, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `bool absl::str_format_internal::FormatArgImpl::Dispatch<signed char>(char * arg, size_t spec, int out, char * )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `bool absl::str_format_internal::FormatArgImpl::Dispatch<signed char>(char * arg, size_t spec, int out, char * )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
