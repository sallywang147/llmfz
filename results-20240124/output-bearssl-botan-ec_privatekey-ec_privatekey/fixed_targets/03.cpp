 The build error message indicates that there is an undefined reference to `Botan::EC_PrivateKey`. This means that the linker cannot find the definition of this class. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that defines this class is included in the source file.

In this case, the header file that defines the `Botan::EC_PrivateKey` class is `botan/ec_key.h`. However, this header file is already included in the source file, so it should not be causing the build error.

One possible explanation for the build error is that the `botan/ec_key.h` header file is not being found by the compiler. This can happen if the Botan library is not installed correctly or if the include path is not set correctly.

To fix this, make sure that the Botan library is installed correctly and that the include path is set correctly. You can do this by following the instructions in the Botan documentation.

Once the Botan library is installed correctly and the include path is set correctly, the build error should go away.
