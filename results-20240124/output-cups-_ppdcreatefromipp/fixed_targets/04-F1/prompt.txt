Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include "cups/cups.h"
#include "cups/ppd.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char *buffer = new char[bufsize];
  const size_t ipp_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const uint8_t *ipp_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(ipp_size);
  ipp_t *supported = ippNew();
  ippReadMem(supported, ipp_data, ipp_size);

  char *ppd = _ppdCreateFromIPP(buffer, bufsize, supported);
  if (ppd) {
    delete[] ppd;
  }
  delete[] buffer;
  ippDelete(supported);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
