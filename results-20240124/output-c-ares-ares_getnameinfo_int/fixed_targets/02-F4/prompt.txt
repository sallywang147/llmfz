Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <ares.h>
#include <netdb.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ares_version.h>
}

// Entrypoint for Clang's libfuzzer
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data,
                           unsigned long size) {
  // Feed the data into ares_getnameinfo_int.
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
  struct sockaddr addr;
  int addrlen = sizeof(addr);
  int flags = 0;
  ares_callback callback = NULL;
  char host[NI_MAXHOST];
  ares_getnameinfo_int(&channel, &addr, addrlen, flags, callback, host);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
