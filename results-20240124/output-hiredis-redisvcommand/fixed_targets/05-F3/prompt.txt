Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <redis.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    redisContext *c = redisConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
    if (c == NULL) {
        cout << "Connection error!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    redisReply *reply = (redisReply *)redisCommand(c, "PING");
    if (reply == NULL) {
        cout << "Command error!" << endl;
        redisFree(c);
        return 1;
    }

    cout << "Server response: " << reply->str << endl;
    freeReplyObject(reply);
    redisFree(c);

    return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `char * redisvCommand(struct redisContext * c, char * format, struct __va_list_tag * ap)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `char * redisvCommand(struct redisContext * c, char * format, struct __va_list_tag * ap)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
