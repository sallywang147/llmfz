Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <brotli/encode.h>

extern "C" {
#include <brotli/decode.h>
}

int main() {
  BrotliEncoderCompressStream(nullptr, 0, nullptr, 0, nullptr, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/h2o/fuzz/driver_h3.cc:8:3: error: no matching function for call to 'BrotliEncoderCompressStream'
  BrotliEncoderCompressStream(nullptr, 0, nullptr, 0, nullptr, nullptr);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/src/h2o/deps/brotli/c/include/brotli/encode.h:335:28: note: candidate function not viable: requires 7 arguments, but 6 were provided

                           ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
