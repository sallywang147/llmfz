Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <brotli/encode.h>

extern "C" {
#include <brotli/encode.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // ...
  int quality = 11;
  int lgwin = 22;
  size_t compressed_size = 0;
  char *compressed_buffer = new char[size];
  BrotliEncoderCompress(quality, lgwin, 0, size, (char *)data, &compressed_size, compressed_buffer);
  // ...
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/h2o/fuzz/driver_h3.cc:13:3: error: no matching function for call to 'BrotliEncoderCompress'
  BrotliEncoderCompress(quality, lgwin, 0, size, (char *)data, &compressed_size, compressed_buffer);

1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
