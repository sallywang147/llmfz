Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderCreateInstance'
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderSetParameter'
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderCompressStream'
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderDestroyInstance'
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderCreateInstance'
/src/h2o/fuzz/driver_h3.cc:1:1: error: unknown type name 'undefined'
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderCreateInstance'
^
/src/h2o/fuzz/driver_h3.cc:1:20: error: expected ';' after top level declarator
undefined reference to `BrotliEncoderCreateInstance'
                   ^
                   ;
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
