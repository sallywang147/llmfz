Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "h2o.h"
#include "h2o/compress.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t quality = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 11);
  size_t window_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 24);
  struct st_h2o_compress_context_t* ctx =
      h2o_compress_brotli_open(NULL, quality, window_size, 0);
  if (ctx == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  h2o_compress_brotli_close(ctx);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
/src/h2o/fuzz/driver_h3.cc:9:10: fatal error: 'h2o/compress.h' file not found
#include "h2o/compress.h"
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
