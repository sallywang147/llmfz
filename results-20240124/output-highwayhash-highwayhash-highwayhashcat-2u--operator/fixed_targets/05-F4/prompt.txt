Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_dynamic.h>

extern "C" {
#include <highwayhash/highwayhash_dynamic.h>
}

namespace highwayhash {

template <uint64_t kSeed>
void HighwayHashCat(bool key, StringView* fragments, size_t num_fragments,
                    bool hash) {
  HighwayHashCat<kSeed>()(key, fragments, num_fragments, hash);
}

}  // namespace highwayhash

extern "C" {

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  StringView fragments[2];
  fragments[0] = StringView(data, size);
  highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<0>(false, fragments, 1, true);
  return 0;
}

}  // extern "C"
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<2u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, bool  hash) const` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<2u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, bool  hash) const` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
