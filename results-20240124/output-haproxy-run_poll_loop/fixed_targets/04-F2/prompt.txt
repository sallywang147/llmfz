Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <algorithm>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "ev.h"
#include "ev_config.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  ev_tstamp timeout = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  ev_loop_t* loop = ev_loop_new(EVFLAG_AUTO);
  ev_timer timer;
  ev_timer_init(&timer, NULL, timeout, 0.);
  ev_timer_start(loop, &timer);
  run_poll_loop(loop);
  ev_timer_stop(loop, &timer);
  ev_loop_destroy(loop);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
fuzz_cfg_parser.c:1:10: fatal error: 'algorithm' file not found
#include <algorithm>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

Fix failure
fuzz_cfg_parser.cpp:9:10: fatal error: 'ev.h' file not found
#include "ev.h"
         ^~~~~~
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
