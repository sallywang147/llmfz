Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>

extern "C" {
#include <hiredis/async.h>
#include <hiredis/sds.h>
}

int main() {
  redisAsyncContext *c = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
  if (c->err) {
    std::cout << "Error: " << c->errstr << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  redisAsyncCommand(c, NULL, NULL, "SET key value");
  redisAsyncDisconnect(c);

  // Call redisCommandArgv to satisfy the fuzzer
  redisCommandArgv(c, 2, (char*[]) {"SET", "key value"}, NULL);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
