Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <vector>
#include <boost/asio.hpp>

using namespace boost::asio;

// Wrap the header with extern "C" {} to fix the linking issue
extern "C" {
#include "StartTcpServer.h"
}

int main() {
  // Create a thread to run the TCP server
  std::thread server_thread(StartTcpServer);

  // Wait for the server thread to finish
  server_thread.join();

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
