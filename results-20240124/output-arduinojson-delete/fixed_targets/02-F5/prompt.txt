Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <ArduinoJson.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ArduinoJson/Variant/VariantSlot.hpp>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot* slot = new (ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot::operator new(sizeof(ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot), nullptr)) ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot();
  delete slot;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
msgpack_fuzzer.cpp:10:3: error: no suitable member 'operator delete' in 'VariantSlot'
  delete slot;
  ^
../../src/ArduinoJson/Variant/VariantSlot.hpp:31:15: note: member 'operator delete' declared here
  static void operator delete(void*, void*) noexcept {}
              ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
