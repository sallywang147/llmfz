Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <ArduinoJson.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot v;
  ::operator delete(v.ptr, v.ptr);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
msgpack_fuzzer.cpp:9:23: error: no member named 'ptr' in 'ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot'
  ::operator delete(v.ptr, v.ptr);
                    ~ ^
msgpack_fuzzer.cpp:9:30: error: no member named 'ptr' in 'ArduinoJson::detail::VariantSlot'
  ::operator delete(v.ptr, v.ptr);
                           ~ ^
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
