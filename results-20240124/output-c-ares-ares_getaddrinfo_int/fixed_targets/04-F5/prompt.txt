Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>

#include "ares.h"

// Entrypoint for Clang's libfuzzer
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data,
                           unsigned long size) {
  // Feed the data into each of the ares_parse_*_reply functions.
  ares_channel channel;
  int status = ares_init(&channel);
  if (status != ARES_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }
  struct ares_addrinfo_hints hints;
  hints.ai_flags = ARES_AI_CANONNAME;
  hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
  hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
  hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;
  ares_getaddrinfo(&channel, NULL, NULL, &hints, NULL, NULL);
  ares_destroy(&channel);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void ares_getaddrinfo_int(struct ares_channeldata * , char * , char * , struct ares_addrinfo_hints * , func_type * , char * )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void ares_getaddrinfo_int(struct ares_channeldata * , char * , char * , struct ares_addrinfo_hints * , func_type * , char * )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
