Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "hiredis.h"

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    struct redisAsyncContext *ac;
    if (size < 3)
        return 0;
    ac = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
    if (ac == NULL)
        return 0;

    redisAsyncRead(ac);
    redisAsyncFree(ac);
    return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
