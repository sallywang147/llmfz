Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int gss_init_sec_context(int * minor_status, struct gss_cred_id_struct * claimant_cred_handle, struct gss_ctx_id_struct ** context_handle, struct gss_name_struct * target_name, struct gss_OID_desc_struct * mech_type, int req_flags, int time_req, struct gss_channel_bindings_struct * input_chan_bindings, struct gss_buffer_desc_struct * input_token, struct gss_OID_desc_struct ** actual_mech_type, struct gss_buffer_desc_struct * output_token, int * ret_flags, int * time_rec)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int gss_init_sec_context(int * minor_status, struct gss_cred_id_struct * claimant_cred_handle, struct gss_ctx_id_struct ** context_handle, struct gss_name_struct * target_name, struct gss_OID_desc_struct * mech_type, int req_flags, int time_req, struct gss_channel_bindings_struct * input_chan_bindings, struct gss_buffer_desc_struct * input_token, struct gss_OID_desc_struct ** actual_mech_type, struct gss_buffer_desc_struct * output_token, int * ret_flags, int * time_rec)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
