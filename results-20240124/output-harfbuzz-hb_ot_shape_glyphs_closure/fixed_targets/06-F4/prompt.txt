Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <hb.h>
#include <hb-ot.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  hb_font_t *font = hb_font_create();
  hb_buffer_t *buffer = hb_buffer_create();
  hb_feature_t *features = (hb_feature_t *)malloc(sizeof(hb_feature_t) * 1);
  features[0].tag = HB_TAG('a', 'a', 'a', 'a');
  features[0].value = 1;
  hb_set_t *glyphs = hb_set_create();
  hb_ot_shape_glyphs_closure(font, buffer, features, 1, glyphs);
  hb_font_destroy(font);
  hb_buffer_destroy(buffer);
  free(features);
  hb_set_destroy(glyphs);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
