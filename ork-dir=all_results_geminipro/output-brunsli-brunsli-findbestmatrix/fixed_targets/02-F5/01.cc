#include <brunsli/decode.h>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::vector<int> matrix(16);
  brunsli::FindBestMatrix(matrix.data(), false, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `brunsli` library is not included.
2. The `stddef.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

To fix the code, we need to:

1. Include the `brunsli` library by adding the following line at the beginning of the code:
```c++
#include <brunsli/decode.h>
```
2. Wrap the `stddef.h` header with `extern "C" {}` by changing the following line:
```c++
#include <stddef.h>
```
to:
```c++
extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}
```

The corrected code is shown above.
