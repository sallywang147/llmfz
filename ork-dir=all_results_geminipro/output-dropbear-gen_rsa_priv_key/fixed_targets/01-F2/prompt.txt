Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "dropbear_dss.h"
#include "dropbear_ecdh.h"
#include "dropbear_ed25519.h"
#include "dropbear_key.h"
#include "dropbear_rsakey.h"
#include "dropbear_types.h"
#include "ssh.h"

extern "C" {
#include "dropbear_dss.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int key_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1024);
  struct dropbear_DSS_Key* key = gen_dss_priv_key(key_size);
  dropbear_dss_key_free(key);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'gen_dss_priv_key'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `gen_dss_priv_key`. To fix this, we need to include the header file that contains the definition of this function. In this case, the header file is `dropbear_dss.h`.

However, simply including `dropbear_dss.h` is not enough. The reason is that the function `gen_dss_priv_key` is declared in C, but the rest of the code is in C++. To make the C function visible to the C++ code, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is shown above.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `struct dropbear_DSS_Key * gen_rsa_priv_key(int size)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `struct dropbear_DSS_Key * gen_rsa_priv_key(int size)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
