Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  int argc = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 10);
  std::vector<char*> argv(argc);
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
    size_t len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
    argv[i] = new char[len + 1];
    provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(argv[i], len);
    argv[i][len] = '\0';
  }

  int ret = main2(argc, argv.data());

  for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
    delete[] argv[i];
  }

  return ret;
}
```

The build error was caused by the missing `stdlib.h` header. To fix it, we need to include this header inside an `extern "C" {}` block. This is because `stdlib.h` contains C functions and variables, and we need to tell the compiler that we want to use them in a C++ program.

The fixed code includes the `stdlib.h` header inside an `extern "C" {}` block, which allows us to use the C functions and variables from `stdlib.h` in our C++ program.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
