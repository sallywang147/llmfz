Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <Eigen/Dense>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int rows = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int cols = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> matrix(rows, cols);
  for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
      matrix(i, j) = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
    }
  }
  matrix.~Matrix();
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
