Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
size_t FC_Initialize(char *);
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string str = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(size);
  char *ptr = str.c_str();
  FC_Initialize(ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

1. The declaration of `FC_Initialize` is missing its return type.
2. The `#include` directive for `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` is missing.

To fix these issues, add the following lines to the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

size_t FC_Initialize(char *);
```

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

size_t FC_Initialize(char *);

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
size_t FC_Initialize(char *);
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string str = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(size);
  char *ptr = str.c_str();
  FC_Initialize(ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
