Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "png.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* input_cstr = const_cast<char*>(input.c_str());
  png_image_read_direct(input_cstr);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has been fixed by wrapping the `#include "png.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `png.h` header file contains C-style function declarations, which are not compatible with C++ function declarations by default. The `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to treat the included header file as a C header file, which allows the C-style function declarations to be used in the C++ code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
