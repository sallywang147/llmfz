Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "png.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* input_cstr = const_cast<char*>(input.c_str());
  png_image image;
  png_image_read_from_memory(&image, input_cstr, input.size());
  png_image_free(&image);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The function `png_image_read_direct` is not defined in the `png.h` header file.
2. The function `png_image_read_from_memory` is not defined in the `png.h` header file.
3. The function `png_image_free` is not defined in the `png.h` header file.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The function `png_image_read_direct` was replaced with `png_image_read_from_memory`.
2. The function `png_image_free` was added to free the allocated memory.
3. The header file `png.h` was included with the `extern "C"` directive to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
