Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <rawspeed/ArwDecoder.h>
#include <rawspeed/RawImage.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);

  // Extract an array of bytes as a vector. You MUST call .data() to use result as pointer.
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 100000));
  void *data_ptr = bytes.data();

  // Extract to user defined object
  rawspeed::RawImage obj;
  size_t consumed = stream.ConsumeData(&obj, sizeof(obj));

  // Extract to user defined object
  rawspeed::ArwDecoder obj2;
  size_t consumed2 = stream.ConsumeData(&obj2, sizeof(obj2));

  // Call the function
  obj2.decodeSRF(&obj); // Fix: Call decodeSRF as a member function of obj2

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code calls the `decodeSRF` function as a member function of the `obj2` object, which is the correct way to call member functions in C++. The original code had a syntax error where it was calling `decodeSRF` as a function pointer, which is incorrect.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
