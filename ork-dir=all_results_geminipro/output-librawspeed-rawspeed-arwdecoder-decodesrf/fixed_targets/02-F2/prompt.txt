Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "rawspeed/ArwDecoder.h"
#include "rawspeed/Buffer.h"
#include "rawspeed/DataBuffer.h"
#include "rawspeed/Endianness.h"
#include "rawspeed/RawImage.h"
#include "rawspeed/RawspeedException.h"
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  assert(Data);

  try {
    const rawspeed::Buffer b(Data, rawspeed::implicit_cast<rawspeed::Buffer::size_type>(Size));
    const rawspeed::DataBuffer db(b, rawspeed::Endianness::little);
    rawspeed::ArwDecoder dec;
    rawspeed::RawImage img;

    dec.decodeSRF(&img, &dec);
  } catch (const rawspeed::RawspeedException &) {
    return 0;
  }

  __builtin_unreachable();
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'
```

This means that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is not defined in the code. To fix this error, we need to include the header file that defines this function.

In this case, the header file is `libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h`. We need to add the following line to the top of the code:

```
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
```

After adding this line, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
