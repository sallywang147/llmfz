Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <fuzzing/types/Container.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzing/fuzzer_test_common.h>
}

using namespace fuzzing;
using namespace fuzzing::types;

// A fuzzer that reads a sequence of characters and stores them in a
// Container.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider data_provider(data, size);

  // Create a Container to store the characters.
  Container<char, true, false> container;

  // Read the characters from the data provider and store them in the
  // Container.
  while (data_provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    char c = data_provider.ConsumeIntegral<char>();
    container.push_back(c);
  }

  // Destroy the Container.
  container.~Container();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was missing its return type. It should be `int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size)`.

2. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for it to be visible to the fuzzer.

3. The `container.~Container()` line was missing a semicolon.

The fixed code addresses all of these issues and should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
