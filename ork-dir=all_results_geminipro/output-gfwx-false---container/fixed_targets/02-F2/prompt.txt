Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzing/datasource/datasource.hpp>
#include <fuzzing/types/container.hpp>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  fuzzing::datasource::Datasource ds(data, size);
  const auto numElements = ds.Get<uint64_t>() % 1024;
  fuzzing::types::Container<char, true, false> c(numElements);
  c.~Container();
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `stdlib.h` header was not included. This header is necessary for the `exit` function to be used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. To fix this, the `stdlib.h` header has been included using the `extern "C" {}` block.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
