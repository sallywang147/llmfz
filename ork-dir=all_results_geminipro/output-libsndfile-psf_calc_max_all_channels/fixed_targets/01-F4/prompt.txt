Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <sndfile.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#include "sndfile_fuzz_header.h"

extern "C" {
#include <psflib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) { // One byte is needed for deciding which function to target.
  if (size == 0)
    return 0;

  const uint8_t decider = *data;
  data += 1;
  size -= 1;

  SF_INFO sndfile_info;
  VIO_DATA vio_data;
  SF_VIRTUAL_IO vio;
  SNDFILE *sndfile = NULL;
  int err = sf_init_file(data, size, &sndfile, &vio_data, &vio, &sndfile_info);
  if (err)
    goto EXIT_LABEL;

  // Just the right number of channels. Create some buffer space for reading.
  double *peaks_buffer = NULL;
  peaks_buffer = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * sndfile_info.channels);
  if (peaks_buffer == NULL)
    abort();

  // Use the decider to determine which function to call.
  switch (decider) {
  case 0:
    psf_calc_max_all_channels(sndfile->private_data, peaks_buffer, decider % 2);
    break;
  case 1:
    psf_calc_max_left_channel(sndfile->private_data, peaks_buffer, decider % 2);
    break;
  case 2:
    psf_calc_max_right_channel(sndfile->private_data, peaks_buffer, decider % 2);
    break;
  }

  free(peaks_buffer);

EXIT_LABEL:
  if (sndfile != NULL)
    sf_close(sndfile);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

- The `psf_calc_max_left_channel` and `psf_calc_max_right_channel` functions were not being called.
- The `decider` variable was not being used to determine which function to call.
- The `peaks_buffer` variable was not being freed when an error occurred.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

- Adding a `switch` statement to call the appropriate function based on the value of `decider`.
- Freeing the `peaks_buffer` variable when an error occurs.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
