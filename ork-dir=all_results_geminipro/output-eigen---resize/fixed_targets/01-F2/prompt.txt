Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "Eigen/Core"

extern "C" {
#include "Eigen/Eigenvalues"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t nrows = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  const size_t ncols = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  Eigen::Transpose<Eigen::Block<Eigen::Matrix<std::__1::complex<float>, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1>, -1, 1, true>> transpose;
  transpose.resize(&transpose, nrows, ncols);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that it was attempting to use the `Eigen::Eigenvalues` library without including the necessary header file. This caused the linker to complain about an undefined reference to the `Eigen::Eigenvalues` library.

To fix this, we have added the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "Eigen/Eigenvalues"
```

This includes the necessary header file and allows the linker to find the `Eigen::Eigenvalues` library.

We also wrapped the `#include "Eigen/Eigenvalues"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the symbols in the header file. This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, which means that it must be able to be called from C code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
