Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "impeg2d.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libavcodec/avcodec.h"
}

static int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct _stream_t stream;
  stream.p_buffer = data;
  stream.i_buffer = size;
  stream.i_cur_byte = 0;
  stream.i_bit_offset = 0;

  short sym_len[256];
  short sym_val[256];

  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero(&stream, sym_len, sym_val);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
