extern "C" {
#include "mpeg2dec.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct _stream_t s = {};
  s.p_buffer = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>().data();
  s.size = size;

  short sym_len = 0;
  short sym_val = 0;
  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero(&s, &sym_len, &sym_val);

  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following issues:

1. The header file `mpeg2dec.h` is not included.
2. The function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero` is declared without the `extern "C"` keyword.

To fix the first issue, we need to add the following line to the top of the source code:

```c++
#include "mpeg2dec.h"
```

To fix the second issue, we need to add the `extern "C"` keyword to the declaration of the function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero`.

The corrected code is shown above.
