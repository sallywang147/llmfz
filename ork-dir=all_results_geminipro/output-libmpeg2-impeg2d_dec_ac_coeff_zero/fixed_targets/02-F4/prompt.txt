Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares this function is included in the source code.

In this case, the header file is `mpeg2dec.h`. We can include it by adding the following line to the top of the source code:

```c++
#include "mpeg2dec.h"
```

After adding this line, the code should compile and link successfully.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "mpeg2dec.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct _stream_t s = {};
  s.p_buffer = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>().data();
  s.size = size;

  short sym_len = 0;
  short sym_val = 0;
  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero(&s, &sym_len, &sym_val);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
