The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares this function is included in the source code.

In this case, the header file is `mpeg2dec.h`. We can include it by adding the following line to the top of the source code:

```c++
#include "mpeg2dec.h"
```

After adding this line, the code should compile and link successfully.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "mpeg2dec.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct _stream_t s = {};
  s.p_buffer = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>().data();
  s.size = size;

  short sym_len = 0;
  short sym_val = 0;
  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero(&s, &sym_len, &sym_val);

  return 0;
}
```
