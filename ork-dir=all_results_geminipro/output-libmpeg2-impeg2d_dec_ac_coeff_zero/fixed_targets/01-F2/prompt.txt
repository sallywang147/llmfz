Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "mpeg2dec.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mpeg2dec_ac_coeff_zero.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct _stream_t stream_struct;
  stream_struct.p_buffer = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>().data();
  stream_struct.buffer_size = size;
  stream_struct.next_byte_index = 0;
  stream_struct.bits_left = 8;

  short sym_len;
  short sym_val;
  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_zero(&stream_struct, &sym_len, &sym_val);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
