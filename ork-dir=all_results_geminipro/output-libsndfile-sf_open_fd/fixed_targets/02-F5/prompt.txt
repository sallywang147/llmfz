Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <sndfile.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#include "sndfile_fuzz_header.h"

extern "C" {
#include <sndfile.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) { // One byte is needed for deciding which function to target.
  if (size == 0)
    return 0;

  const uint8_t decider = *data;
  data += 1;
  size -= 1;

  SF_INFO sndfile_info;
  SNDFILE *sndfile = NULL;
  int err = sf_open_fd(decider, SFM_READ, &sndfile_info, 0);
  if (err)
    goto EXIT_LABEL;

  // Just the right number of channels. Create some buffer space for reading.
  switch (decider % 3) {
  case 0: {
    short *read_buffer = NULL;
    read_buffer = (short *)malloc(sizeof(short) * size / sndfile_info.channels);
    if (read_buffer == NULL)
      abort();

    while (sf_readf_short(sndfile, read_buffer, size / sndfile_info.channels)) {
      // Do nothing with the data.
    }
    free(read_buffer);
  } break;
  case 1: {
    int *read_buffer = NULL;
    read_buffer = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * size / sndfile_info.channels);
    if (read_buffer == NULL)
      abort();

    while (sf_readf_int(sndfile, read_buffer, size / sndfile_info.channels)) {
      // Do nothing with the data.
    }
    free(read_buffer);
  } break;
  case 2: {
    double *read_buffer = NULL;
    read_buffer = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * size / sndfile_info.channels);
    if (read_buffer == NULL)
      abort();

    while (sf_readf_double(sndfile, read_buffer, size / sndfile_info.channels)) {
      // Do nothing with the data.
    }
    free(read_buffer);
  } break;
  default:
    break;
  };

EXIT_LABEL:
  if (sndfile != NULL)
    sf_close(sndfile);

  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: 'sf_read_short' was not declared in this scope
error: 'sf_read_int' was not declared in this scope
error: 'sf_read_double' was not declared in this scope
```

This is because the `sf_read_short`, `sf_read_int`, and `sf_read_double` functions are not declared in the global scope. To fix this, we need to include the `sndfile.h` header file, which declares these functions.

We also need to wrap the `#include <sndfile.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the functions are declared with C linkage. This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with C linkage, and the functions in `sndfile.h` are declared with C++ linkage by default.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
