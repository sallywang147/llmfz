Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <sndfile.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#include "sndfile_fuzz_header.h"

extern "C" {
#include <sndfile.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) { // One byte is needed for deciding which function to target.
  if (size == 0)
    return 0;

  const uint8_t decider = *data;
  data += 1;
  size -= 1;

  SF_INFO sndfile_info;
  SNDFILE *sndfile = NULL;
  int err = sf_open_fd(decider % 2, decider % 3, &sndfile_info, SFM_READ, decider % 2);
  if (err)
    goto EXIT_LABEL;

  while (sf_read_short(sndfile, NULL, size, SF_COUNT_MAX)) {
    // Do nothing with the data.
  }

EXIT_LABEL:
  if (sndfile != NULL)
    sf_close(sndfile);

  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'sf_open_fd'
```

The issue is that the `sf_open_fd` function is declared in the `sndfile.h` header, but it is not defined in the program. To fix this, the program needs to link with the `libsndfile` library, which contains the definition of `sf_open_fd`. This can be done by adding the following line to the top of the program:

```c++
#include <sndfile.h>
```

After adding this line, the program should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
