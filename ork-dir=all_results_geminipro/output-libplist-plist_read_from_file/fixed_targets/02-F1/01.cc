The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'plist_read_from_file'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `plist_read_from_file`. This is because the header file `plist/plist.h` does not contain the definition of this function. To fix this error, we need to include the library that contains the definition of this function.

The library that contains the definition of `plist_read_from_file` is called `libplist`. To include this library, we need to add the following line to the top of the file:

```
#include <libplist.h>
```

After adding this line, the linker will be able to find the definition of `plist_read_from_file` and the error will be resolved.
