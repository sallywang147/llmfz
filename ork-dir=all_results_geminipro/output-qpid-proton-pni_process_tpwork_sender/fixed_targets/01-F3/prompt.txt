Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "pni_transport.h"

extern "C" {
#include "proton/message.h"
#include "proton/transport.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  pn_transport_t* transport = pn_transport();
  pn_delivery_t* delivery = pn_delivery(transport);
  std::vector<uint8_t> payload = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>();
  int ret = pni_process_tpwork_sender(transport, delivery,
                                      reinterpret_cast<char*>(payload.data()));
  pn_transport_free(transport);
  pn_delivery_free(delivery);
  return ret;
}
```

The fixed code creates the `pn_delivery_t` object using the `pn_delivery` function, passing the `pn_transport_t` object as an argument. This ensures that the `pn_delivery_t` object is associated with the correct transport.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
