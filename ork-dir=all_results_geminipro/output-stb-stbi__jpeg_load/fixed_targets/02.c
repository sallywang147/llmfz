The issue with the original code was that it was missing the `stbi_image_free` function to free the allocated memory for the image data. This can lead to memory leaks and crashes.

The fixed code includes the `stbi_image_free` function to properly free the allocated memory after the image data is no longer needed. This ensures that the memory is released back to the system and prevents memory leaks.
