Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the `stbi_is_16_bit_from_file` function is not defined in the `stb_image.h` header. To fix this, the `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` macro needs to be defined before including the header.

The corrected code:
```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STBI_ONLY_JPEG
#define STBI_ONLY_PNG
#define STBI_ONLY_BMP
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FILE *f = fmemopen(data, size, "rb");

  int result = stbi_is_16_bit_from_file(f);

  fclose(f);

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
