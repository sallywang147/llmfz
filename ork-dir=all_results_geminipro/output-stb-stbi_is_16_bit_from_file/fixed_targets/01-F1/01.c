The issue with the original code was that it used `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` instead of `STBI_IMPLEMENTATION`. The `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` macro is used for the header-only version of the library, while the `STBI_IMPLEMENTATION` macro is used for the library that is built as a shared object or static library.

To fix the issue, we need to change the `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` macro to `STBI_IMPLEMENTATION`.
