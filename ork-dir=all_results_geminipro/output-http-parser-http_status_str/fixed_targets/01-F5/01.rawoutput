```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "http_parser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "http_parser.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int status_code = *(int *)data;
  const char *status_str = http_status_str(status_code);
  if (status_str != NULL) {
    free((void *)status_str);  // Fix: Cast status_str to void * before calling free
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that `free` was being called with a `const char *` argument, which is not allowed. To fix this, the code has been updated to cast `status_str` to `void *` before calling `free`. This is necessary because `free` expects a pointer to a memory location that can be modified, but `const char *` is a pointer to a constant memory location.

The corrected code should now compile and run without errors.
