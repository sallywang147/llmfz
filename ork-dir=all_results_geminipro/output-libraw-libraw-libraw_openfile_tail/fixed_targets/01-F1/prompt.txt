Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <exception>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libraw/libraw.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider data(Data, Size);

  LibRaw *raw = new LibRaw();
  std::exception *stream = nullptr;

  try {
    raw->libraw_open_buffer(data.ConsumeRemainingBytes(), Size);
    raw->libraw_openfile_tail(raw, stream);
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    std::fprintf(stderr, "Exception: %s\n", e.what());
  }

  delete raw;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
