Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <exception>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libraw/libraw.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider data(Data, Size);

  LibRaw *raw = new LibRaw();
  std::exception *stream = nullptr;

  try {
    raw->libraw_open_buffer(data.ConsumeRemainingBytes(), Size);
    raw->libraw_openfile_tail(raw, stream);
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    std::fprintf(stderr, "Exception: %s\n", e.what());
  }

  delete raw;
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include <libraw/libraw.h>` directive. This is necessary because the `libraw` library is written in C, and its symbols are not exported in a way that is compatible with C++ linkage. By wrapping the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`, we tell the compiler to treat the `libraw` symbols as C symbols, which allows them to be linked with the C++ code.

Here is a breakdown of the changes made:

* Added `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include <libraw/libraw.h>` directive.
* Changed the `#include <libraw/libraw.h>` directive to `#include <libraw/libraw.h>`.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
