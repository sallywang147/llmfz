Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "wpa_supplicant.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h"
#include "wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wpa_supplicant wpa_s;
  struct wpa_interface iface;

  const std::string ifname = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  iface.ifname = const_cast<char*>(ifname.c_str());

  wpa_supplicant_init_iface(&wpa_s, &iface);

  return 0;
}
```

The provided code includes the `wpa_supplicant.h` header file, but it also uses functions declared in `wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h` and `wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.h`. To resolve the build error, we need to include these additional header files as well.

To do this, we enclose the `#include` directives for these header files within an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the header files contain C declarations, and we're compiling the code as C++. The `extern "C"` block tells the compiler to treat the enclosed declarations as C declarations, which allows the linker to find and resolve the references to the functions declared in these headers.

Here's the corrected code with the necessary changes:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "wpa_supplicant.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h"
#include "wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wpa_supplicant wpa_s;
  struct wpa_interface iface;

  const std::string ifname = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  iface.ifname = const_cast<char*>(ifname.c_str());

  wpa_supplicant_init_iface(&wpa_s, &iface);

  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile successfully and run as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
