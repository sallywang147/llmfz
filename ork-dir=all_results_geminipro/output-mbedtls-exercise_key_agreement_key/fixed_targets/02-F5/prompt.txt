Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

// Wrap the header include with extern "C" {} to fix the linking issue.
extern "C" {
#include <openssl/evp.h>
}

// Declare the missing function.
void exercise_key_agreement_key(int key, int usage, int alg);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int key = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int usage = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int alg = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  exercise_key_agreement_key(key, usage, alg);
  return 0;
}

// Define the missing function.
void exercise_key_agreement_key(int key, int usage, int alg) {
  // Implement the function to exercise the key agreement key.
  // This code is just a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual implementation.
  printf("Exercising key agreement key with key: %d, usage: %d, alg: %d\n", key, usage, alg);
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The missing function `exercise_key_agreement_key` was defined.
2. The implementation of the function was replaced with a placeholder that prints the key, usage, and algorithm values. This placeholder should be replaced with the actual implementation of the function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
