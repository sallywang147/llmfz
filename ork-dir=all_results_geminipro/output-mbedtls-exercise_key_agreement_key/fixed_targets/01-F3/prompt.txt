Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "key_agreement.h" // Include the header file that declares exercise_key_agreement_key

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const int key = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int usage = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int alg = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  exercise_key_agreement_key(key, usage, alg);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the function `exercise_key_agreement_key` was being called without being declared or defined. To fix this, the header file that declares this function (`key_agreement.h`) was included.

Additionally, the `#include` directive for the header file was wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function declaration is visible to the linker. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C++ file, and the fuzzer is written in C.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
