Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libbpf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "bpf_load.h"
}

static int libbpf_print_fn(enum libbpf_print_level level, const char *format, va_list args) { return 0; }

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object *obj = NULL;
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  err = bpf_object__open_file(data, size, &obj, &opts);
  if (err)
    return 0;

  bpf_object__close(obj);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int bpf_object__open_skeleton(struct bpf_object_skeleton * s, struct bpf_object_open_opts * opts)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int bpf_object__open_skeleton(struct bpf_object_skeleton * s, struct bpf_object_open_opts * opts)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
