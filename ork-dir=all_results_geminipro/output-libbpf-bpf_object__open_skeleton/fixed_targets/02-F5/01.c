The issue in the code was that the `libbpf.h` header was included twice, once with the `extern "C" {}` wrapper and once without. This caused a conflict between the two declarations of the `bpf_object__open_skeleton` function.

To fix the issue, the second inclusion of `libbpf.h` was removed. Now, the code includes the header only once, with the `extern "C" {}` wrapper, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.
