Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libbpf.h"

static int libbpf_print_fn(enum libbpf_print_level level, const char *format, va_list args) { return 0; }

extern "C" {
#include <libbpf/bpf.h>

int bpf_object__open_skeleton(struct bpf_object_skeleton *skel, const void *data, size_t size,
                              const struct bpf_object_open_opts *opts);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object_skeleton skel = {};
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  err = bpf_object__open_skeleton(&skel, data, size, &opts);
  if (err)
    return 0;

  bpf_object__close_skeleton(&skel);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `libbpf.h` header is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `bpf_object__open_skeleton` function is declared in the `libbpf/bpf.h` header.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
