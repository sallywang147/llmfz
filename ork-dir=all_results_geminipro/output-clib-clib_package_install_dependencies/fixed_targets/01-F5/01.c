The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `extern "C" {}` block is added around the `#include "../../src/common/clib-package.h"` line to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names in the header file. This is necessary because the header file is written in C and expects the function names to be unmangled.

2. The `#include <unistd.h>` line is added to include the `unlink` function, which is used to delete the temporary file created by the program.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
