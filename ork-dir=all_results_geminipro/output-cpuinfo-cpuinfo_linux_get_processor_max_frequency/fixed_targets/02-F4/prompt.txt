Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <linux/api.h>
#include <x86/linux/api.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cpuinfo.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.config");

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  struct cpuinfo_x86_linux_processor processors[256];
  cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo(256, processors);
  for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
    if (cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency(i) == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  unlink(filename);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo'
```

This error occurs because the function `cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo` is declared in the header file `<cpuinfo.h>`, but the definition of the function is not included in the program.

To fix this error, you need to link the program with the library that contains the definition of the function. In this case, the library is `libcpuinfo`.

You can do this by adding the following line to the top of the program:
```
#include <libcpuinfo.h>
```

This will include the header file `<libcpuinfo.h>` which will in turn include the definition of the function `cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo`.

After adding this line, the program should build and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
