Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <linux/api.h>
#include <x86/linux/api.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cpuinfo.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.config");

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  struct cpuinfo_x86_linux_processor processors[256];
  cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo(256, processors);
  for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
    if (processors[i].valid) {
      cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency(processors[i].processor,
                                                &(processors[i].max_frequency));
    }
  }

  unlink(filename);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `cpuinfo.h` header was not included with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo` and `cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency` functions.

The fixed code includes the `cpuinfo.h` header with `extern "C" {}`, which tells the linker to look for the function definitions in the C language, rather than the C++ language. This allows the linker to find the function definitions and resolve the undefined reference errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
