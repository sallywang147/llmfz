Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <linux/api.h>
#include <x86/linux/api.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cpuinfo.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.config");

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  struct cpuinfo_x86_linux_processor processors[256];
  cpuinfo_x86_linux_parse_proc_cpuinfo(256, processors);
  for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
    if (processors[i].valid) {
      cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency(processors[i].processor);
    }
  }

  unlink(filename);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had two issues:

1. The function `cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency` takes an argument of type `unsigned int`, but the code was passing an `int`. This was causing the build error.
2. The loop was iterating over all 256 processors, but the `processors` array was only initialized for the first 256 processors. This could lead to undefined behavior.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues. It now passes the correct argument type to `cpuinfo_linux_get_processor_max_frequency`, and it only iterates over the processors that are actually valid.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
