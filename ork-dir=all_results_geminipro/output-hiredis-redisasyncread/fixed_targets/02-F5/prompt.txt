Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  redisAsyncContext *ac = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
  if (ac == NULL || ac->err) {
    return 0;
  }

  redisAsyncSetConnectCallback(ac, [](const redisAsyncContext *ac, int status) {
    if (status != REDIS_OK) {
      exit(1);
    }
  });

  redisAsyncSetDisconnectCallback(ac, [](const redisAsyncContext *ac, int status) {
    exit(1);
  });

  redisAsyncCommand(ac, NULL, NULL, "PING");
  redisAsyncHandleRead(ac);
  if (ac != NULL) {
    redisAsyncFree(ac);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

- Added the `stdlib.h` header.
- Specified a callback function for the `redisAsyncRead` function.
- Checked if `ac` is not NULL before calling `redisAsyncFree`.
- Added `redisAsyncSetConnectCallback` and `redisAsyncSetDisconnectCallback` to handle connection and disconnection events.
- Added `redisAsyncCommand` to send a PING command to the Redis server.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
