Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include "qemu/osdep.h"
#include "qemu/host-utils.h"
#include "qemu/disas.h"
#include "cpu.h"

extern "C" {
#include "qemu/mips.h"
#include "qemu/qemu-common.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct CPUMIPSState *env = (struct CPUMIPSState *)malloc(sizeof(*env));
  struct DisasContext *ctx = (struct DisasContext *)malloc(sizeof(*ctx));

  memset(env, 0, sizeof(*env));
  memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(*ctx));

  ctx->isa = MIPS_CPU_32;
  ctx->endianness = MIPS_CPU_LE;
  ctx->pc = 0;
  ctx->ins_len = 4;

  int ret = decode_nanomips_opc(env, ctx, data);

  free(env);
  free(ctx);

  return ret;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `decode_nanomips_opc` function takes an additional argument, `data`, which is the input data to be decoded. This argument was missing in the original code, causing the linker to complain about an undefined reference to `decode_nanomips_opc`.

To fix this, we have added the `data` argument to the `decode_nanomips_opc` function call. Now, the code should compile and run correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
