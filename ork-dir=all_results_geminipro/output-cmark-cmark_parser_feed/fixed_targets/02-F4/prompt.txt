Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "cmark.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct cmark_parser *parser = cmark_parser_new(CMARK_OPT_DEFAULT);
  cmark_parser_feed(parser, (char *)data, size);
  cmark_node *document = cmark_parser_finish(parser);
  cmark_parser_free(parser);
  cmark_node_free(document);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had no errors. The build error message was not provided, so there was no way to fix the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
