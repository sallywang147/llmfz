The issue with the original code was that the `janet.h` header was included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C" {}` wrapper. This caused a conflict between the two declarations of the `janet_init()` and `janet_deinit()` functions, leading to the linker error.

To fix the issue, the `janet.h` header was included only once, with the `extern "C" {}` wrapper. This ensured that there was only one declaration of the `janet_init()` and `janet_deinit()` functions, resolving the linker error.
