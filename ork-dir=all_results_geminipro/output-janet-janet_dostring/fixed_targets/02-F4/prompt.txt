Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janet/vm.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetTable *env = janet_core_env();
  JanetBuffer buf = janet_string(data, size);
  Janet result;
  janet_dostring(env, buf.data, buf.data + buf.count, &result);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The only issue in the original code is that the header `janet/vm.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. To fix this, the header should be included as follows:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include <janet/vm.h>
}
```

This ensures that the C++ compiler will use the C calling convention when calling the functions declared in the header, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
