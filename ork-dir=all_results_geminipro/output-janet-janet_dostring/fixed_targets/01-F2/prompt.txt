Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janet.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetTable *env = janet_core_env();
  JanetBuffer *buffer = janet_buffer(data, size);
  Janet result;

  janet_dostring(env, buffer, "fuzz", &result);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The issue here is that the `janet.h` header file is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can cause linker errors because the compiler will see two different definitions of the same symbols.

To fix this, we can move the `#include <janet.h>` line inside the `extern "C"` block, so that it is only included once. This will ensure that the compiler sees a single definition of the symbols in `janet.h`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
