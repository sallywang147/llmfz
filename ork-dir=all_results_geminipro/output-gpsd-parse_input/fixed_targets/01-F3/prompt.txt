Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "gpsd_config.h" /* must be before all includes */

#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include "gpsd.h"

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 9216

extern "C" {
#include "gpsd/tests//test_packet.c"
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct gps_device_t gps_device;
  size_t parse_input_result = parse_input(&gps_device);
  return LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput((const uint8_t *)argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
