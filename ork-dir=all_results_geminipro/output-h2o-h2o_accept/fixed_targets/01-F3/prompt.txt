Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "h2o.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint16_t port = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>();
  const uint16_t backlog = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>();
  const std::string host = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct st_h2o_accept_ctx_t accept_ctx;
  memset(&accept_ctx, 0, sizeof(accept_ctx));
  h2o_accept(&accept_ctx, nullptr);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `h2o.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `h2o.h` header file contains C function declarations, and the C++ compiler expects C++ function declarations. By wrapping the header file with `extern "C" {}`, we are telling the compiler that the functions declared in the header file are C functions, and not C++ functions.

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
