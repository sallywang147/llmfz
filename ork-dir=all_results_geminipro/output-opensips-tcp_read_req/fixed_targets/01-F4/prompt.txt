Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "tcp.h"
}

extern "C" void tcp_read_req(struct tcp_connection *con, void *data);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t buf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  char buf[buf_size];
  const uint8_t bytes_read = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  struct tcp_connection con = {0};
  con.rbuf = buf;
  con.rbuf_size = buf_size;
  con.rbytes = bytes_read;
  tcp_read_req(&con, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. The `#include "tcp.h"` directive was wrapped with the `extern "C"` directive.
2. The `tcp_read_req` function was declared in the `tcp.h` header file.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
