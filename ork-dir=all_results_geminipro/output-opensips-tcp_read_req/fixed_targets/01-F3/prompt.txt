Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "tcp.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t buf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  char buf[buf_size];
  const uint8_t bytes_read = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  struct tcp_connection con = {0};
  con.rbuf = buf;
  con.rbuf_size = buf_size;
  con.rbytes = bytes_read;
  tcp_read_req(&con, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `tcp.h` header file is not included with the `extern "C"` directive, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.
2. The `tcp_read_req` function is not declared in the `tcp.h` header file. This means that the compiler does not know about the existence of this function and will generate an error when trying to call it.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Wrap the `#include "tcp.h"` directive with the `extern "C"` directive, like this:
```c++
extern "C" {
#include "tcp.h"
}
```
2. Declare the `tcp_read_req` function in the `tcp.h` header file, like this:
```c++
extern "C" void tcp_read_req(struct tcp_connection *con, void *data);
```

After making these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
