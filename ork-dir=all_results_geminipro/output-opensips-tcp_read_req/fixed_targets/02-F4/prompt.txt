Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "tcp_connection.h"

extern "C" {
#include "tcp_connection.h"
}

// Declare the function `tcp_read_req` in the header file `tcp_connection.h`.
int tcp_read_req(struct tcp_connection* con, int* bytes_read);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct tcp_connection con;
  int bytes_read;

  // Initialize the `tcp_connection` struct before calling `tcp_read_req`.
  tcp_connection_init(&con);
  tcp_read_req(&con, &bytes_read);

  // Clean up the `tcp_connection` struct after use.
  tcp_connection_deinit(&con);

  return 0;
}
```

The provided code has the following issues:

- The `tcp_read_req` function is not declared in the `tcp_connection.h` header file.
- The `tcp_connection` struct is not initialized before calling `tcp_read_req`.
- The `tcp_connection` struct is not cleaned up after use.

The fixed code includes the necessary `#include` directives, declares the `tcp_read_req` function in the `tcp_connection.h` header file, initializes the `tcp_connection` struct before calling `tcp_read_req`, and cleans up the `tcp_connection` struct after use.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
