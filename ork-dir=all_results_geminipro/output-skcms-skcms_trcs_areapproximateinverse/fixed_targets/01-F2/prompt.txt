Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "skcms.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t profile_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000000);
  const uint8_t* profile_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(profile_size);
  skcms_ICCProfile profile;
  skcms_Parse(&profile, profile_data, profile_size);

  const size_t inv_tf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000000);
  const uint8_t* inv_tf_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(inv_tf_size);
  skcms_TransferFunction inv_tf;
  skcms_ParseTransferFunction(&inv_tf, inv_tf_data, inv_tf_size);

  bool are_approximate_inverse = skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse(&profile, &inv_tf);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The function `skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse` returns a boolean, but the return type of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was `int`. This has been fixed by changing the return type to `bool`.

2. The function `skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.

3. The function `skcms_ParseTransferFunction` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.

4. The function `skcms_Parse` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
