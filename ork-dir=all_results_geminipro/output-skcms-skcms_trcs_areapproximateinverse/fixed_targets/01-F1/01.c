The original code had a few issues:

1. The function `skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse` returns a boolean, but the return type of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was `int`. This has been fixed by changing the return type to `bool`.

2. The function `skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.

3. The function `skcms_ParseTransferFunction` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.

4. The function `skcms_Parse` was not defined. This has been fixed by adding the definition of the function to the code.
