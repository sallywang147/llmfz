Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "skcms.h"

extern "C" {
  int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
    const size_t profile_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
    const uint8_t* profile_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(profile_size);
    skcms_ICCProfile profile;
    skcms_ParseICCProfile(&profile, profile_data, profile_size);

    const size_t inv_tf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
    const uint8_t* inv_tf_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(inv_tf_size);
    skcms_TransferFunction inv_tf;
    skcms_ParseTransferFunction(&inv_tf, inv_tf_data, inv_tf_size);

    skcms_TRCs_AreApproximateInverse(&profile, &inv_tf);
    skcms_FreeICCProfile(&profile);
    skcms_FreeTransferFunction(&inv_tf);
    return 0;
  }
}
```

The issue was that the `skcms_FreeICCProfile` and `skcms_FreeTransferFunction` functions were not called to free the allocated memory for the `profile` and `inv_tf` variables, respectively. This could lead to memory leaks and other issues.

To fix the issue, the `skcms_FreeICCProfile` and `skcms_FreeTransferFunction` functions were added to the end of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to free the allocated memory.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
