Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <exception>
#include <stdexcept>

#include "src/exif.h"
#include "fuzzing/datasource/datasource.hpp"
#include "shared.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  fuzzing::datasource::Datasource ds(data, size);

  try {
    std::exception *exception = nullptr;
    const int orientation = ds.Get<int>();
    int *result = nullptr;

    const bool ok = piex::GetExifOrientation(exception, orientation, result);

    (void)ok;
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    // Handle the exception here.
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Included the `<stdexcept>` header to handle the `std::exception` class.
2. Changed the `catch (...)` to `catch (const std::exception &e)` to catch only `std::exception` exceptions.
3. Added a comment to the `catch` block to indicate that the exception should be handled there.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
