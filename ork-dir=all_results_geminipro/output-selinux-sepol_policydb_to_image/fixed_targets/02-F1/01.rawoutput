```c++
#include <sepol/policydb/policydb.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  sepol_handle_t *handle = sepol_handle_create();
  sepol_policydb_t *policydb = sepol_policydb_create();
  char *newdata = nullptr;
  size_t newlen = 0;

  sepol_policydb_read(handle, policydb, data, size);
  sepol_policydb_to_image(handle, policydb, &newdata, &newlen);

  sepol_policydb_free(policydb);
  sepol_handle_destroy(handle);
  free(newdata);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `sepol_policydb_read` function is declared in the `sepol/policydb/policydb.h` header, which is a C header file.

When compiling the code with a C++ compiler, the C header file needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to prevent name mangling.

Name mangling is a process by which the C++ compiler changes the names of functions and variables to make them unique.

This is done to avoid conflicts between symbols with the same name in different parts of the program.

However, when linking a C++ program with a C library, the C++ compiler expects the symbols in the C library to have the same names as they are declared in the C header file.

If the symbols are mangled, the linker will not be able to find them and will report an error.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for the `sepol/policydb/policydb.h` header needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

This will prevent the C++ compiler from mangling the symbols in the header file, and the linker will be able to find them when linking the program.
