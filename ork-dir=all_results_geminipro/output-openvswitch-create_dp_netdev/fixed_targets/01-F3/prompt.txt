Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "dpif.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 64);
  char* name = static_cast<char*>(malloc(name_len + 1));
  stream.ConsumeBytes(name, name_len);
  name[name_len] = '\0';

  dp_netdev* dp = nullptr;
  const int ret = create_dp_netdev(name, nullptr, &dp);
  if (ret != 0) {
    free(name);
    return 0;
  }
  dpif_destroy_dp_netdev(dp);
  free(name);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code is as follows:

1. The `dpif.h` header file is missing. It should be included in the code.
2. The `create_dp_netdev` and `dpif_destroy_dp_netdev` functions are not declared in the code. They should be declared as `extern "C"` functions.

The corrected code includes the `dpif.h` header file and declares the `create_dp_netdev` and `dpif_destroy_dp_netdev` functions as `extern "C"` functions. This allows the linker to find the definitions of these functions in the `dpif.h` header file.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
