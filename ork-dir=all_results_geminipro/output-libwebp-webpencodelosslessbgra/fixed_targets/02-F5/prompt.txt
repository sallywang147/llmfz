Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <webp/encode.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <webp/encode.h>
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t width = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  const size_t height = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  const size_t bits_per_sample = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 32);
  const std::vector<uint8_t> input = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(width * height * bits_per_sample / 8);

  char* output = nullptr;
  const size_t output_size = WebPEncodeLosslessBGRA(
      reinterpret_cast<const char*>(input.data()), width, height, bits_per_sample, &output);
  free(output);
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the `webp/encode.h` header file, which is necessary for using the `WebPEncodeLosslessBGRA` function. This should fix the compilation error and allow the code to run successfully.

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `#include <webp/encode.h>` line was added to the top of the file.
* The `reinterpret_cast<char*>(input.data())` was changed to `reinterpret_cast<const char*>(input.data())`. This is because the `WebPEncodeLosslessBGRA` function expects a const pointer to the input data.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
