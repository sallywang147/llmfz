Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "llhttp.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <llhttp.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // We need one byte to determine the method name
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Get the method name
  int method = data[0];
  data += 1;
  size -= 1;

  // Call the function to fuzz
  const char *method_name = llhttp_method_name(method);

  // Use the result
  if (method_name != NULL) {
    printf("Method name: %s\n", method_name);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build error because the header `#include <llhttp.h>` is included twice. This is not allowed in C++. To fix this, we can wrap the second `#include` with `extern "C" {}` to indicate that it is a C header file. This will prevent the compiler from trying to parse it as a C++ header file.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
