#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  __cxx_global_var_init();
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error is caused by the missing header file `fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h`. This header file is required for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to be defined. To fix the error, we need to include this header file in our code.

Since `fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h` is a C header file, we need to wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to prevent name mangling. This ensures that the function names in the header file are not mangled by the C++ compiler, which would make them inaccessible to the C linker.

The corrected code is shown above.
