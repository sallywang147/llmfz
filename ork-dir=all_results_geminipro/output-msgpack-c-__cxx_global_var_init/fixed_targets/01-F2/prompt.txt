Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  __cxx_global_var_init();
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error is caused by the missing header file `fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h`. This header file is required for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to be defined. To fix the error, we need to include this header file in our code.

Since `fuzzer/libfuzzer_example.h` is a C header file, we need to wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to prevent name mangling. This ensures that the function names in the header file are not mangled by the C++ compiler, which would make them inaccessible to the C linker.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
