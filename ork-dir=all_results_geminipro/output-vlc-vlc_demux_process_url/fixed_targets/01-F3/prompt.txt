Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif

#include "src/input/demux-run.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h>
}

static struct vlc_run_args args;

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {
  (void)argc;
  (void)argv;

  vlc_run_args_init(&args);

  return 0;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t url_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  std::string url = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString(url_size);
  vlc_demux_process_url(&args, url.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `src/input/demux-run.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the functions and variables in this header to be mangled, but the linker is looking for them with their original names.

2. The function `vlc_run_args_init` is not declared in any header file. This causes a compiler error because the compiler doesn't know what this function is.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Wrap the `#include` directive for `src/input/demux-run.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to compile this header file as C code, which means that the functions and variables in this header will not be mangled.

2. Add a declaration for the function `vlc_run_args_init` to a header file that is included by the source file that uses this function. In this case, we can add the declaration to the header file `src/input/demux-run.h`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
