Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif

#include "src/input/demux-run.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libavutil/avutil.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv);
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size);

static struct vlc_run_args args;

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {
  (void)argc;
  (void)argv;

  vlc_run_args_init(&args);

  return 0;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  vlc_demux_process_url(&args, const_cast<char*>(url.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'av_log_default_callback'
```

This error is caused by the use of the `av_log_default_callback` function from the `libavutil` library, which is not included in the code. To fix this, the `libavutil` library needs to be included.

To include the `libavutil` library, the following line should be added to the top of the code:

```c++
#include <libavutil/avutil.h>
```

In addition, the `#include` directive for `libavutil/avutil.h` needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is properly linked.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
