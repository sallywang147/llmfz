The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `src/input/demux-run.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the functions and variables in this header to be mangled, but the linker is looking for them with their original names.

2. The function `vlc_run_args_init` is not declared in any header file. This causes a compiler error because the compiler doesn't know what this function is.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Wrap the `#include` directive for `src/input/demux-run.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to compile this header file as C code, which means that the functions and variables in this header will not be mangled.

2. Add a declaration for the function `vlc_run_args_init` to a header file that is included by the source file that uses this function. In this case, we can add the declaration to the header file `src/input/demux-run.h`.

The corrected code is shown above.
