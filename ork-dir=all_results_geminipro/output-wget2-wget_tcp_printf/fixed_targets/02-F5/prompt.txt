Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "wget.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wget_tcp_st tcp;
  memset(&tcp, 0, sizeof(tcp));

  std::string format = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  size_t ret = wget_tcp_printf(&tcp, format.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

* The `wget.h` header file is not included.
* The `wget_tcp_printf` function is not declared as `extern "C"`.

The fixed code includes the `wget.h` header file and declares the `wget_tcp_printf` function as `extern "C"`. This allows the linker to find the definition of the `wget_tcp_printf` function and resolve the error.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
