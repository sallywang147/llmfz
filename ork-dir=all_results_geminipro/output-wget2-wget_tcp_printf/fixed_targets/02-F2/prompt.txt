Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "wget.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wget_tcp_st tcp;
  memset(&tcp, 0, sizeof(tcp));

  std::string format = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  size_t ret = wget_tcp_printf(&tcp, format.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `wget_tcp_printf` function is declared with `const char*` as the second argument, but the `format` variable is of type `std::string`. This will cause a compiler error.
2. The `format` variable is declared as a `std::string`, but the `wget_tcp_printf` function expects a `const char*`. This will also cause a compiler error.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

1. Changing the second argument of the `wget_tcp_printf` function to `char*`.
2. Converting the `format` variable to a `char*` using the `c_str()` method.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
