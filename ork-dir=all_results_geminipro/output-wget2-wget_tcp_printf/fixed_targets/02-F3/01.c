The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'wget_tcp_printf'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the `wget_tcp_printf` function. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares the function is included in the source file.

In this case, the header file is `wget.h`. We can include it by adding the following line to the top of the source file:

```c++
#include "wget.h"
```

Once we have included the header file, the linker will be able to find the definition of the `wget_tcp_printf` function and the error will be resolved.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "wget.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wget_tcp_st tcp;
  memset(&tcp, 0, sizeof(tcp));

  std::string format = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  size_t ret = wget_tcp_printf(&tcp, format.c_str());
  return 0;
}
