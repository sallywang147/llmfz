Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <libdwarf.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  Dwfl_Module* module = dwfl_module_create_from_memory(data, size, 0, 0, 0);
  if (module == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  Dwfl_Frame* frame = dwfl_frame_create();
  if (frame == nullptr) {
    dwfl_module_destroy(module);
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    size_t pc = provider.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
    char isactivation = provider.ConsumeBool();
    bool ret = dwfl_frame_pc(frame, &pc, &isactivation);
    if (!ret) {
      break;
    }
  }

  dwfl_frame_destroy(frame);
  dwfl_module_destroy(module);

  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'dwfl_module_create_from_memory'
error: undefined reference to 'dwfl_module_destroy'
error: undefined reference to 'dwfl_frame_create'
error: undefined reference to 'dwfl_frame_destroy'
error: undefined reference to 'dwfl_frame_pc'
```
This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of these functions. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library containing these functions is linked with our program. In this case, the library is `libdwarf`. We can do this by adding the following line to the top of our program:

```
#include <libdwarf.h>
```

This will include the header file for `libdwarf`, which will tell the linker where to find the definitions of the functions we are using.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
