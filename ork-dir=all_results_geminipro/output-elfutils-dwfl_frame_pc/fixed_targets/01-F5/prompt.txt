Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "libunwind.h"
#include "libiberty.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    unw_init_local(unw_local_addr_space, NULL);
    initialized = true;
  }

  unw_cursor_t cursor;
  unw_context_t uc;
  unw_getcontext(&uc);
  unw_init_local(&cursor, &uc);

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  size_t pc;
  char isactivation;
  while (unw_step(&cursor) > 0) {
    if (provider.remaining_bytes() == 0) {
      break;
    }
    const size_t next_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
        0,
        provider.remaining_bytes());
    auto next_input = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(next_size);
    dwfl_frame_pc(cursor.dwarf.frame, &pc, &isactivation);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
The fixed code is provided above. The only change is that the `#include "libiberty.h"` directive is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function declarations in `libiberty.h` are exported with C linkage, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
