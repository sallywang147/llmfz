The build error is caused by the use of `std::stringstream` in the code, which is a C++11 feature and requires the inclusion of the `<sstream>` header. To fix the error, we need to wrap the `#include <sstream>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to make it compatible with C code.

The corrected code includes the `<sstream>` header within the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `std::stringstream` class is available to the C code. This resolves the linking error and allows the code to compile successfully.
