Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <boost/json/json_spirit.hpp>
#include <boost/json/parser.hpp>
#include <boost/json/value.hpp>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::string json_string = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::istringstream stream(json_string);
  boost::json::value value;
  boost::json::read(stream, value);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code used `boost::json::operator>>` to parse the JSON string. However, this operator is deprecated and has been replaced by `boost::json::read`. The corrected code uses `boost::json::read` to parse the JSON string, which resolves the build error.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
