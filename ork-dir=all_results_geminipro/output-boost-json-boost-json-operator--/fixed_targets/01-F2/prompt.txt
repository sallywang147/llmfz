Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <boost/json.hpp>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include <sstream>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::string json_input = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::stringstream ss(json_input);
  boost::json::value jv;
  boost::json::operator>>(std::addressof(ss), std::addressof(jv));
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the use of `std::stringstream` in the code, which is a C++11 feature and requires the inclusion of the `<sstream>` header. To fix the error, we need to wrap the `#include <sstream>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to make it compatible with C code.

The corrected code includes the `<sstream>` header within the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `std::stringstream` class is available to the C code. This resolves the linking error and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
