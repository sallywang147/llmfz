Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hsql_bison.h"
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <cstring>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  yy_buffer_state buffer = yy_scan_string(input.c_str());
  hsql_push_buffer_state(buffer, nullptr);
  yy_delete_buffer(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build issue because the header `hsql_bison.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the compiler to generate an "undefined reference to" error when linking the object files.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `hsql_bison.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the header as a C header, which is necessary for linking with the C++ code.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
