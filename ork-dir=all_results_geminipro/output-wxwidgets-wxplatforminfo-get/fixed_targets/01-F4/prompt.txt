Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "wx/platinfo.h"
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  wxPlatformInfo::Get();
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The header `wx/wx.h` was missing the `extern "C" {}` wrapper. This is necessary because the header contains C++ code, and the fuzzer expects C code.
2. The function `wxPlatformInfo::Get()` was not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for the fuzzer to be able to call it.

The fixed code includes the `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include "wx/wx.h"` header and declares the `wxPlatformInfo::Get()` function as `extern "C"`. This allows the fuzzer to successfully build and run the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
