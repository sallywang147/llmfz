Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/daemon/lldpd.h"
#include <libevent/event.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  struct lldpd cfg;
  levent_init(&cfg);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the necessary header file `libevent/event.h` for the `levent_init` function. This has been added to the fixed code.

Additionally, the `levent_init` function is declared in the `libevent` library, which requires the `extern "C"` wrapper around the header include to ensure proper linking. This has also been added to the fixed code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
