Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/daemon/lldpd.h"
#include <event2/event.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  struct lldpd cfg;
  levent_init(&cfg);
  free(cfg.levent_base);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: 'free' was not declared in this scope
```

This error is because the `free` function is not declared in the current scope. To fix this, we need to include the `<stdlib.h>` header, which declares the `free` function.

We also need to free the `cfg.levent_base` member after we are done using it. This is because `levent_init` allocates memory for this member, and we need to free it to avoid a memory leak.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
