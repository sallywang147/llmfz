Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/daemon/lldpd.h"
#include <libevent/event.h>

extern "C" {
  #include <libevent/event.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  struct lldpd cfg;
  levent_init2(&cfg, 0);  // Fix: Use levent_init2 instead of levent_init
  levent_free(&cfg);  // Fix: Free the allocated memory
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Changed `levent_init` to `levent_init2` in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
2. Added `levent_free(&cfg);` to free the allocated memory before returning from the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
