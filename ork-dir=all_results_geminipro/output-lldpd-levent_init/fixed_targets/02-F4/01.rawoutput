```c++
#include "../src/daemon/lldpd.h"
#include <event2/event.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  struct lldpd cfg;
  levent_init(&cfg);
  free(cfg.levent_base);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: 'free' was not declared in this scope
```

This error is because the `free` function is not declared in the current scope. To fix this, we need to include the `<stdlib.h>` header, which declares the `free` function.

We also need to free the `cfg.levent_base` member after we are done using it. This is because `levent_init` allocates memory for this member, and we need to free it to avoid a memory leak.

The corrected code is shown above.
