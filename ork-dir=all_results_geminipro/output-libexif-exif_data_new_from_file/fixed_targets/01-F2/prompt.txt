Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <libexif/exif-data.h>
#include <libexif/exif-loader.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  auto file_path = std::string("/tmp/fuzz_file_") + std::to_string(rand());
  FILE *fp = fopen(file_path.c_str(), "wb");
  if (fp == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  auto image = exif_data_new_from_file(const_cast<char *>(file_path.c_str()));
  if (image) {
    // Exercise the EXIF tag manipulation code
    exif_data_get_mnote_data(image);
    exif_data_fix(image);
    exif_data_unref(image);
  }
  remove(file_path.c_str());
  return 0;
}
```

The issue here was that the C standard library functions `fopen`, `fclose`, `fwrite`, `remove`, and `rand` were used without including the necessary headers. To fix this, `stdio.h`, `unistd.h`, and `stdlib.h` were included within an `extern "C" {}` block.

Additionally, `const_cast` was used to remove the `const` qualifier from the `file_path.c_str()` argument passed to `exif_data_new_from_file`. This is necessary because the `exif_data_new_from_file` function expects a non-const char pointer.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
