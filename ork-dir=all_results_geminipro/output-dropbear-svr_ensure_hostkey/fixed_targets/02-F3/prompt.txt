Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The corrected code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libssh/libssh.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  svr_ensure_hostkey();
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `libssh` library is not linked.
2. The `svr_ensure_hostkey()` function is not defined.

To fix the first issue, we need to link the `libssh` library when compiling the program. This can be done by adding the `-lssh` flag to the compiler command line.

To fix the second issue, we need to define the `svr_ensure_hostkey()` function. This can be done by adding the following code to the program:

```c++
void svr_ensure_hostkey() {
  // Implement the function here.
}
```

The complete, fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libssh/libssh.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

void svr_ensure_hostkey() {
  // Implement the function here.
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  svr_ensure_hostkey();
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
