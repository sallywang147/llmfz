The original code has the following issues:

1. The `parse_block` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but its definition is missing the `extern "C"` declaration. This can cause linker errors.

2. The `TileWorkerData` and `VP9Decoder` structs are declared as `struct`, but they are used as pointers in the `parse_block` function. This can cause runtime errors.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The `extern "C"` declaration has been added to the definition of the `parse_block` function.

2. The `TileWorkerData` and `VP9Decoder` structs have been declared as pointers in the `parse_block` function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
