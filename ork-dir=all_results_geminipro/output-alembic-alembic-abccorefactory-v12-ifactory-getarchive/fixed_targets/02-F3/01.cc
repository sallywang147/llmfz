The original code had the following issues:

1. The `getArchive` function in the `Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory` class returns an integer to indicate the status of the operation. The original code did not check the return value of this function, which could lead to undefined behavior.
2. The `getArchive` function takes a pointer to an `Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive` object as its second argument. The original code did not initialize this object, which could also lead to undefined behavior.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues. It checks the return value of the `getArchive` function and returns 0 if the operation fails. It also initializes the `Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive` object before passing it to the `getArchive` function.
