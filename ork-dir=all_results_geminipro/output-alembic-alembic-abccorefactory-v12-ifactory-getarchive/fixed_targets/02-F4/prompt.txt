Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Alembic/AbcCoreFactory/v12/IFactory.h"
#include "Alembic/Abc/v12/IArchive.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  std::string filename(reinterpret_cast<char*>(bytes.data()), bytes.size());
  Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory factory;
  Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive archive;
  std::vector<Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory*> factories;
  int num_factories = 0;
  if (factory.getArchive(filename.c_str(), &archive, &factory, &factories, &num_factories) != 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `getArchive` function in the `Alembic::AbcCoreFactory::v12::IFactory` class returns an integer to indicate the status of the operation. The original code did not check the return value of this function, which could lead to undefined behavior.
2. The `getArchive` function takes a pointer to an `Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive` object as its second argument. The original code did not initialize this object, which could also lead to undefined behavior.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues. It checks the return value of the `getArchive` function and returns 0 if the operation fails. It also initializes the `Alembic::Abc::v12::IArchive` object before passing it to the `getArchive` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
