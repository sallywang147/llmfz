Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "scanContentNS.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  char* ptr = const_cast<char*>(provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes());
  char* end = ptr + size;
  char* nextTokPtr;

  struct encoding enc;
  memset(&enc, 0, sizeof(enc));

  int ret = initScanContentNS(&enc, ptr, end, &nextTokPtr);
  if (ret == 0) {
    printf("initScanContentNS returned 0\n");
  } else if (ret == 1) {
    printf("initScanContentNS returned 1\n");
  } else {
    printf("initScanContentNS returned %d\n", ret);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
