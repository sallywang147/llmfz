Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "archive.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  std::vector<std::string> names;
  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    std::string name = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
    names.push_back(name);
  }

  Archive archive;
  for (const auto &name : names) {
    archive.CheckOpen(&archive, const_cast<char *>(name.data()));
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Changed the type of the second argument to `const_cast<char *>(name.data())` in the `CheckOpen` function call.
2. Wrapped the `#include "archive.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C header is properly linked.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
