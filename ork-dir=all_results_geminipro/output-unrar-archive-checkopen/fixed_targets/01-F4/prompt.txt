Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <archive.h>

extern "C" {
#include <archive_entry.h>
void Archive::CheckOpen(Archive *this, int *Name);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::string name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(1024);
  struct archive *archive;
  archive_check_magic(archive, ARCHIVE_MAGIC);

  Archive::CheckOpen(archive, NULL);

  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: ‘struct archive’ has no member named ‘CheckOpen’
```

This error is because the declaration of `Archive::CheckOpen` is not visible to the compiler. To fix this, the header `archive_entry.h` needs to be included. This header contains the declaration of `Archive::CheckOpen`.

The corrected code includes the header `archive_entry.h` and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the declaration of `Archive::CheckOpen` is visible to the compiler.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
