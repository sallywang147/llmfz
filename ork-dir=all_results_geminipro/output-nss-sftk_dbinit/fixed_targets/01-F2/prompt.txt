Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "sftk.h"

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  char* db_path = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_name = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_type = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_user = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_password = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_host = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  char* db_port = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();

  int db_timeout = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int db_retries = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int db_max_connections = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int db_min_connections = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int db_connection_lifetime = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  struct SFTKDBHandleStr* db_handle = nullptr;

  size_t ret = sftk_DBInit(db_path, db_name, db_type, db_user, db_password, db_host, db_port,
                            db_timeout, db_retries, db_max_connections, db_min_connections,
                            db_connection_lifetime, &db_handle);

  if (db_handle != nullptr) {
    sftk_DBClose(db_handle);
  }

  return ret;
}
```

The issue was with the declaration of `db_handle2`. It was declared as a pointer to a `SFTKDBHandleStr` struct, but it was never used. This caused the compiler to issue an "unused variable" warning.

To fix this, the declaration of `db_handle2` has been removed.

Additionally, the `sftk_DBInit` function only returns a single `SFTKDBHandleStr*`, so the second parameter to the function has been removed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
