```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "incclasscanon.h" // Include the header file that defines incclasscanon
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct Reclass {
    int dummy;
  };
  struct Reclass* cc = new struct Reclass;
  int c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int result = incclasscanon(cc, c);
  delete cc;
  return result;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The header file `incclasscanon.h` was not included, which caused the linker to complain about an undefined reference to `incclasscanon`.
* The `incclasscanon.h` header file was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary when compiling C++ code that calls C functions.

The corrected code includes the `incclasscanon.h` header file and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`, which fixes the linker error.
