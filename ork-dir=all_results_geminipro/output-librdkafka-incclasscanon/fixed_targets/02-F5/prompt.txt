Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "incclasscanon.h" // Include the header file that defines incclasscanon
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct Reclass {
    int dummy;
  };
  struct Reclass* cc = new struct Reclass;
  int c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int result = incclasscanon(cc, c);
  delete cc;
  return result;
}
```

The corrected code includes the `incclasscanon.h` header file and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`, which fixes the linker error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
