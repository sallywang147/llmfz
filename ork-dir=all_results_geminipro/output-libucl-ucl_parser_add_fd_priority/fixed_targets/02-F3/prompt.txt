Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ucl.h"
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/tree.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // If size is 0 we need a null-terminated string.
  // We dont null-terminate the string and by the design
  // of the API passing 0 as size with non null-terminated string
  // gives undefined behavior.
  if (size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  struct ucl_parser *parser;
  parser = ucl_parser_new(0);

  // Create a pipe.
  int pipe_fds[2];
  if (pipe(pipe_fds) == -1) {
    perror("pipe");
    return 0;
  }

  // Write the data to the pipe.
  if (write(pipe_fds[1], data, size) == -1) {
    perror("write");
    return 0;
  }

  // Add the pipe to the parser.
  if (!ucl_parser_add_fd_priority(parser, pipe_fds[0], 0)) {
    perror("ucl_parser_add_fd_priority");
    return 0;
  }

  // Parse the data.
  if (ucl_parser_get_error(parser) != NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Clean up.
  ucl_parser_free(parser);
  close(pipe_fds[0]);
  close(pipe_fds[1]);

  return 0;
}
```

The build issues are:
1. The error message "undefined reference to `xmlParseDoc`" indicates that the function `xmlParseDoc` is not defined. This is because the header file `libxml/parser.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include <libxml/parser.h>
```

2. The error message "undefined reference to `xmlFreeDoc`" indicates that the function `xmlFreeDoc` is not defined. This is because the header file `libxml/tree.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include <libxml/tree.h>
```

3. The error message "undefined reference to `ucl_parser_new`" indicates that the function `ucl_parser_new` is not defined. This is because the header file `ucl.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "ucl.h"
```

4. The error message "undefined reference to `ucl_parser_add_fd_priority`" indicates that the function `ucl_parser_add_fd_priority` is not defined. This is because the header file `ucl.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "ucl.h"
```

5. The error message "undefined reference to `ucl_parser_get_error`" indicates that the function `ucl_parser_get_error` is not defined. This is because the header file `ucl.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "ucl.h"
```

6. The error message "undefined reference to `ucl_parser_free`" indicates that the function `ucl_parser_free` is not defined. This is because the header file `ucl.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "ucl.h"
```

After adding these header files, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
