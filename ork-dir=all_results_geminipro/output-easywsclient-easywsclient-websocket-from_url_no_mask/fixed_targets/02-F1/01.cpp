#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "easywsclient.hpp"
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "easywsclient.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string str(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  easywsclient::WebSocket::from_url_no_mask(str);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the build error is caused by the missing declaration of the `easywsclient::WebSocket` class in the `easywsclient.h` header file. To fix this, we need to include the `easywsclient.h` header file and wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ symbols are exported in a way that can be linked to by the C code.

The corrected code includes the `easywsclient.h` header file within the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the C++ symbols are properly exported for linking. This should resolve the build error and allow the code to compile successfully.
