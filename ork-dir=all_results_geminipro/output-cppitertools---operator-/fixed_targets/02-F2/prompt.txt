Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <iterator>
#include <vector>

using iter::Compressed;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  std::vector<int> v;
  for (int i = 0; i < fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024); i++) {
    v.push_back(fdp.ConsumeIntegral<int>());
  }
  std::vector<bool> b;
  for (int i = 0; i < fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024); i++) {
    b.push_back(fdp.ConsumeBool());
  }
  auto c = Compressed<std::vector<int> &, std::vector<bool> &>(v, b);
  auto it = c.begin();
  while (it != c.end()) {
    int *val = *it;
    (void)val; // This line was missing in the original code.
    it++;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added the missing line `int *val = *it;` inside the loop that iterates over the `Compressed` object. This line is necessary to call the `operator*` function of the `Compressed` iterator, which was the cause of the build error.

2. Wrapped the `#include <iterator>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the undefined reference error. This is necessary because the `iterator` header includes C++ standard library headers that use C++ name mangling, which is not compatible with the C linkage required by the fuzzer.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
