```c++
#include <coap3/coap.h>
#include <coap3/ws.h>

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_session_t *session = coap_new_session(NULL, NULL, COAP_PROTO_UDP);
  if (session) {
    coap_ws_close(session);
    coap_free_session(session);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an error because the header file `coap3/ws.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file is written in C, and the rest of the code is written in C++.

To fix the error, the header file `coap3/ws.h` needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can be done by adding the following lines to the top of the file:

```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
```

And the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

This will tell the compiler that the header file is written in C, and that it should not try to mangle the names of the functions and variables in the header file.
