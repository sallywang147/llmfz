Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <coap3/coap_ws.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_ws_session_t *session = coap_ws_new_client_session(NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);
  if (session) {
    coap_ws_close(session);
    coap_ws_free_session(session);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `coap_ws.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause linking errors when compiling the code.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include <coap3/coap_ws.h>` line with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The `coap_ws_new_client_session` function is not declared in the `coap3/coap_ws.h` header. This can cause compilation errors.

To fix this issue, we need to declare the `coap_ws_new_client_session` function in the `coap3/coap_ws.h` header.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
