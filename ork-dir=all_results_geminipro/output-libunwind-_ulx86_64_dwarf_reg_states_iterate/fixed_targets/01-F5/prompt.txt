Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <libunwind.h>
#include <libunwind-x86_64.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Create a dwarf cursor.
  unw_cursor_t cursor;
  unw_getcontext(&cursor);
  unw_init_local(&cursor, NULL);

  // Create a callback function.
  auto callback = [](unw_word_t reg, unw_word_t val, void* arg) -> int {
    // Do something with the register and value.
    return 0;
  };

  // Iterate over the register states.
  int result = _ULx86_64_dwarf_reg_states_iterate(&cursor, callback, NULL);
  if (result != 0) {
    // An error occurred.
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include <libunwind.h>` and `#include <libunwind-x86_64.h>` are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to not be able to find the symbols defined in these headers.

2. The function `_ULx86_64_dwarf_reg_states_iterate` is not declared in any of the included headers. This causes the compiler to not be able to find the function definition.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The headers `#include <libunwind.h>` and `#include <libunwind-x86_64.h>` are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the linker to look for the symbols defined in these headers in the C language namespace.

2. The function `_ULx86_64_dwarf_reg_states_iterate` is declared in the header `#include <libunwind-x86_64.h>`. This tells the compiler where to find the function definition.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
