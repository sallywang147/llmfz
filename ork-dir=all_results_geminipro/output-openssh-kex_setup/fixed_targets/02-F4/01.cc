The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ssh.h` and `kex.h` headers are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause issues when linking the object files, as the C++ compiler may not be able to find the definitions of the functions and variables declared in these headers.

To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directives for these headers with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the compiler to treat the declarations in these headers as C declarations, rather than C++ declarations.

2. The `kex_setup` function is not declared in the `ssh.h` header. This means that the compiler will not be able to find the definition of this function when it tries to compile the code.

To fix this, we need to add a declaration for the `kex_setup` function to the `ssh.h` header. We can do this by adding the following line to the top of the `ssh.h` header:

```c
extern int kex_setup(ssh_session *session, char **proposal);
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
