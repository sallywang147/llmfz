The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ssh.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `ssh.h` header is written in C and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is written in C++.

2. The `ssh_new` and `ssh_free` functions are not declared in the `ssh.h` header. This is because these functions are defined in the `libssh` library. To fix this, we need to link the `libssh` library to our program.

The corrected code includes the `ssh.h` header inside the `extern "C" {}` block, and it also links the `libssh` library to the program. This fixes the build errors and allows the program to compile and run successfully.
