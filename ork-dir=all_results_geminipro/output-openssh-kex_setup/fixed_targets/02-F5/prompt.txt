Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include <ssh/ssh.h>
#include <ssh/kex.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Create a SSH struct.
  ssh_session session;
  ssh_options_set(&session.options, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");
  ssh_init(&session);

  // Create a proposal string.
  const std::string proposal = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* proposal_cstr = strdup(proposal.c_str());

  // Call kex_setup.
  int result = kex_setup(&session, &proposal_cstr);

  // Clean up.
  ssh_finalize(&session);
  free(proposal_cstr);

  return result;
}
```
The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ssh.h` and `kex.h` headers are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause issues when linking the object files, as the C++ compiler may not be able to find the definitions of the functions and variables declared in these headers.

To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directives for these headers with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the compiler to treat the declarations in these headers as C declarations, rather than C++ declarations.

2. The `kex_setup` function is not declared in the `ssh.h` header. This means that the compiler will not be able to find the definition of this function when it tries to compile the code.

To fix this, we need to add a declaration for the `kex_setup` function to the `ssh.h` header. We can do this by adding the following line to the top of the `ssh.h` header:

```c
extern int kex_setup(ssh_session *session, char **proposal);
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
