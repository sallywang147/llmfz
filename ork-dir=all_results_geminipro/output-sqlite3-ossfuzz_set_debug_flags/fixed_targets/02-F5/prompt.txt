Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <ossfuzz/ossfuzz.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int debug_flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ossfuzz_set_debug_flags(debug_flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the `extern "C"` directive around the `#include <ossfuzz/ossfuzz.h>` line. This directive is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler generates a C-compatible interface for the `ossfuzz` functions, which are written in C.

The corrected code includes the `extern "C"` directive, which fixes the build error and allows the program to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
