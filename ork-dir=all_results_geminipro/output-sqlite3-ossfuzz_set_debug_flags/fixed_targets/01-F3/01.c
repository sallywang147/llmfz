#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  ossfuzz_set_debug_flags(debug_flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the `extern "C"` wrapper around the `#include <ossfuzz/ossfuzz.h>` directive. This is necessary because the `ossfuzz` library is written in C, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared in C++. The `extern "C"` wrapper tells the compiler to use the C calling convention for this function, which allows it to be called from C++ code.

The corrected code includes the `extern "C"` wrapper, which fixes the build error and allows the program to be compiled and linked successfully.
