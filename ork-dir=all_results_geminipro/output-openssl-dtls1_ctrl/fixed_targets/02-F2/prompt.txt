Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <openssl/ssl.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  SSL_CTX* ctx = SSL_CTX_new(TLS_method());
  SSL* ssl = SSL_new(ctx);

  int cmd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t larg = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<uint8_t> parg = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(larg);

  dtls1_ctrl(ssl, cmd, larg, reinterpret_cast<char*>(parg.data()));

  SSL_free(ssl);
  SSL_CTX_free(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the `dtls1_ctrl` function is declared in the header `openssl/dtls1.h`, which is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line to the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include <openssl/dtls1.h>
```

This will include the necessary header file and allow the code to compile and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
