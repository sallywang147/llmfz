Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "tcp_req.h"
#include "tcp_connection.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t max_msg_chunks = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  const uint8_t parallel_handling = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  const std::string req_data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct tcp_req req;
  req.data = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(const_cast<char*>(req_data.c_str()));
  req.len = req_data.size();

  struct tcp_connection con;
  con.rbuf_size = 0;
  con.rbuf = nullptr;
  con.wbuf_size = 0;
  con.wbuf = nullptr;
  con.wbuf_offset = 0;

  tcp_handle_req(&req, &con, max_msg_chunks, parallel_handling);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

* The header file `tcp_req.h` and `tcp_connection.h` are not included.
* The function `tcp_handle_req` is not defined.

To fix the code, we need to include the necessary header files and define the function `tcp_handle_req`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
