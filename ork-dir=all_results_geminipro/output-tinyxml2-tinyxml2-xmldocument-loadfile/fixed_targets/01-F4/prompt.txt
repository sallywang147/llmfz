Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
#if !defined(_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS)
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS 
#endif
#endif

extern "C" {
#include "tinyxml2/tinyxml2.h"
}

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string>

#if defined(_MSC_VER) || defined(WIN32)
#include <crtdbg.h>
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#include <windows.h>
_CrtMemState startMemState;
_CrtMemState endMemState;
#else
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#endif

using namespace tinyxml2;
using namespace std;

// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  XMLDocument doc;
  if (doc.Parse(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size) == XML_SUCCESS) {
    // Do something with the parsed document.
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `std::string data_string(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);` line was removed. This line is not necessary because the `XMLDocument::Parse()` method takes a pointer to the data and the size of the data as arguments.
* The `if (doc.LoadFile(data_string.c_str()) == XML_SUCCESS)` line was replaced with `if (doc.Parse(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size) == XML_SUCCESS)`. This change uses the `XMLDocument::Parse()` method instead of the `XMLDocument::LoadFile()` method.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
