Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue with the given code is that the `janet_init()` and `janet_deinit()` functions are not declared in the header file `janet.h`. To fix this, we need to include the `janet.c` file, which contains the definitions for these functions.

Here is the corrected code:
```c++
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "janet.c" // Include the Janet C source file

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetTable *env = janet_table();
  JanetTable *globals = janet_table();
  Janet *ret = janet_dobytes(env, (char *)data, size, (char *)data, globals);
  janet_decref(ret);
  janet_table_dec(env);
  janet_table_dec(globals);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
