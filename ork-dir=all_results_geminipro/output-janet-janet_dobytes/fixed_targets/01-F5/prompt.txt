Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "janet.c" // Include the Janet C source file
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetTable *env = janet_table();
  JanetTable *globals = janet_table();
  Janet *ret = janet_dostring(env, (char *)data, globals);
  janet_decref(ret);
  janet_table_dec(env);
  janet_table_dec(globals);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code:

1. The `janet_dobytes` function is replaced with `janet_dostring` because `janet_dobytes` is not defined in the Janet C library. `janet_dostring` is used to evaluate a Janet string.

2. The `janet_decref` function is called to decrement the reference count of the `ret` Janet value, which is returned by `janet_dostring`. This ensures that the Janet value is properly deallocated when it is no longer needed.

3. The `janet_table_dec` function is called to decrement the reference count of the `env` and `globals` Janet tables. This ensures that the Janet tables are properly deallocated when they are no longer needed.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
