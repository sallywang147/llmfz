Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <png.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libpng16/png.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct png_image image;
  memset(&image, 0, sizeof(image));
  image.version = PNG_IMAGE_VERSION;

  const size_t memory_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char* memory = new char[memory_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(memory, memory_size);

  int result = OSS_FUZZ_png_image_begin_read_from_memory(&image, memory,
                                                       memory_size);
  if (result != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  OSS_FUZZ_png_image_free(&image);
  delete[] memory;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `png.h` is included twice, once with the standard include path and once with the libpng16 include path. This can lead to conflicts and undefined references.
2. The function `OSS_FUZZ_png_image_begin_read_from_memory` and `OSS_FUZZ_png_image_free` are not declared in the code.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The header file `png.h` is included only once, with the libpng16 include path.
2. The functions `OSS_FUZZ_png_image_begin_read_from_memory` and `OSS_FUZZ_png_image_free` are declared in the code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
