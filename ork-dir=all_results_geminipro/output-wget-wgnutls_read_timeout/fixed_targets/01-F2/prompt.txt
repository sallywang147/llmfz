Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "wgnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  char* buf = new char[bufsize];
  const std::string arg = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const double timeout = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  int ret = wgnutls_read_timeout(fd, buf, bufsize, arg.c_str(), timeout);
  delete[] buf;
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `const_cast` used in `wgnutls_read_timeout` is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. It is better to avoid using `const_cast` whenever possible.
2. The `arg` variable is declared as `const std::string`, but it is passed to `wgnutls_read_timeout` as a non-const `char*`. This is incorrect and can lead to undefined behavior.

The fixed code removes the unnecessary `const_cast` and passes the `arg` variable to `wgnutls_read_timeout` as a `const char*`. This ensures that the function is called correctly and that the data is not modified.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
