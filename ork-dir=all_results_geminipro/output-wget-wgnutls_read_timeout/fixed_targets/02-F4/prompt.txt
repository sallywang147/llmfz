Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "wgnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1 << 16);
  char* buf = new char[bufsize];
  const int arg_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1 << 16);
  char* arg = new char[arg_size];
  const double timeout = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();

  wgnutls_read_timeout(fd, buf, bufsize, arg, arg_size, timeout);

  delete[] buf;
  delete[] arg;

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `wgnutls.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions that need to be linked with the C++ code.
2. The `wgnutls_read_timeout` function is not defined in the `wgnutls.h` header file. This is because the function is declared in the `wgnutls` library, which needs to be linked with the C++ code.

To fix the code, we need to wrap the `wgnutls.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and link the `wgnutls` library with the C++ code. We can do this by adding the following lines to the top of the code:

```c++
#include <wgnutls/wgnutls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <wgnutls.h>
}
```

We also need to add the `-lwgnutls` flag to the linker command line. This will tell the linker to link the `wgnutls` library with the C++ code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
