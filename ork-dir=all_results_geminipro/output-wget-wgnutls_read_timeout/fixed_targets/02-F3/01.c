The original code has the following issues:

1. The `wgnutls.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions that need to be linked with the C++ code.
2. The `wgnutls_read_timeout` function is not defined in the `wgnutls.h` header file. This is because the function is declared in the `wgnutls` library, which needs to be linked with the C++ code.

To fix the code, we need to wrap the `wgnutls.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and link the `wgnutls` library with the C++ code. We can do this by adding the following lines to the top of the code:

```c++
#include <wgnutls/wgnutls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <wgnutls.h>
}
```

We also need to add the `-lwgnutls` flag to the linker command line. This will tell the linker to link the `wgnutls` library with the C++ code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
