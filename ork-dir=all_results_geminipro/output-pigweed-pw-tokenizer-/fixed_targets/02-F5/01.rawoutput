```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "pw_tokenizer.h"

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  pw::tokenizer::NestedMessageDetokenizer detokenizer;
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    detokenizer.Process(stream.ConsumeIntegral<char>());
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The header file `pw_tokenizer.h` was included twice. The first inclusion was removed.
2. The `#include` directive for the `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` header file was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
3. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` was declared as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
