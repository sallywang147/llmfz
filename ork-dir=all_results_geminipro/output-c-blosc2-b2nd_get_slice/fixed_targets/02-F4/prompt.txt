Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "b2nd.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  b2nd_context_s* context = b2nd_new_context();
  if (context == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  b2nd_array_t* array = b2nd_create_array(context, 1, 1, 1, B2ND_TYPE_INT32);
  if (array == nullptr) {
    b2nd_free_context(context);
    return 0;
  }
  size_t offset = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  size_t length = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  int result = b2nd_get_slice(context, nullptr, array, &offset, &length);
  if (result != 0) {
    b2nd_free_array(array);
    b2nd_free_context(context);
    return 0;
  }
  b2nd_free_array(array);
  b2nd_free_context(context);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The `b2nd_get_slice` function was called with a `nullptr` as the first argument, which is not allowed.
* The `ConsumeIntegral` function was not used to consume the `offset` and `length` values from the `FuzzedDataProvider`.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

* Passing the correct arguments to `b2nd_get_slice`.
* Using `ConsumeIntegral` to consume the `offset` and `length` values from the `FuzzedDataProvider`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
