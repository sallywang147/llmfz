Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  TestZeroCopyInputStream input_stream;
  JsonArrayTester tester(&input_stream);

  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    // Add a few chucks of data to the input stream.
    for (int i = 0; i < provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 5); i++) {
      input_stream.AddChunk(provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100));
    }

    // Run the array tester to get the next message.
    std::string error_message;
    (void)tester.TestClosed(&error_message);

    // Handle end of input or error due to malformed bytes.
    if (tester.Finished()) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
The issue in the original code was that the `TestZeroCopyInputStream` and `JsonArrayTester` classes were not defined. To fix this, we need to include the necessary headers that define these classes.

The corrected code includes the following headers:

* `<cstddef>`: This header defines various basic data types and macros.
* `<cstdint>`: This header defines various integer types and macros.
* `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>`: This header defines the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, which is used to generate random data for fuzzing.
* `<string>`: This header defines the `std::string` class, which is used to store error messages.

With these headers included, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
