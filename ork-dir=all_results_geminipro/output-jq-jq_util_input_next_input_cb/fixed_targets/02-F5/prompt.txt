Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'jq_init'
```

This means that the function `jq_init` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function.

The corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "jq.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  jq_state* jq = jq_init();
  if (jq == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  jq_util_input_next_input_cb(jq, const_cast<char*>(input.c_str()));
  jq_teardown(&jq);
  return 0;
}
```

We have added the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "jq.h"
```

This includes the header file that defines the `jq_init` function.

Now, the code should build and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
