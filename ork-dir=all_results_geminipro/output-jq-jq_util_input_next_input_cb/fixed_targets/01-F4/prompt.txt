Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "jq.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct jq_state *jq = jq_init();
  jq_util_input_next_input_cb(jq, const_cast<char *>(input.c_str()));
  jq_teardown(&jq);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the provided code is that the `jq.h` header file is not included in the program. This means that the compiler will not be able to find the declarations of the functions and data types that are used in the program.

To fix this issue, you need to include the `jq.h` header file in the program. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of the program:

```c++
#include "jq.h"
```

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "jq.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct jq_state *jq = jq_init();
  jq_util_input_next_input_cb(jq, const_cast<char *>(input.c_str()));
  jq_teardown(&jq);
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the program should now compile and link successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
