Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "libbpf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libbpf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object *obj = NULL;
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  obj = bpf_object__open_mem(data, size, &opts);
  err = libbpf_get_error(obj);
  if (err < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open BPF object: %s\n", strerror(-err));
    return 0;
  }

  bpf_object__load(obj);
  bpf_object__close(obj);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the header `#include "libbpf.h"` is included twice, once without `extern "C" {}` and once with it. This causes a compiler error because the same header is included twice with different preprocessor directives.

To fix the issue, remove the first `#include "libbpf.h"` and keep only the one wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "libbpf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object *obj = NULL;
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  obj = bpf_object__open_mem(data, size, &opts);
  err = libbpf_get_error(obj);
  if (err < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open BPF object: %s\n", strerror(-err));
    return 0;
  }

  bpf_object__load(obj);
  bpf_object__close(obj);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
