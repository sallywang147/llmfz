Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "libbpf.h"

static int libbpf_print_fn(enum libbpf_print_level level, const char *format, va_list args) {
  return vfprintf(stderr, format, args);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object *obj = NULL;
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  obj = bpf_object__open_mem(data, size, &opts);
  err = libbpf_get_error(obj);
  if (err) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open BPF object: %s\n", strerror(-err));
    return 0;
  }

  bpf_object__load(obj);
  bpf_object__close(obj);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. `libbpf_print_fn` is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is required for C++ to link to a C function.
2. The `fprintf` function is not declared in the code, and it should be included from the `<cstdio>` header.
3. The `strerror` function is not declared in the code, and it should be included from the `<cstring>` header.
4. The `libbpf_get_error` function returns a negative error code, but the code checks for a positive error code.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

1. Wrapping the `libbpf_print_fn` declaration with `extern "C"`.
2. Including the `<cstdio>` and `<cstring>` headers.
3. Checking for a negative error code from `libbpf_get_error`.
4. Printing the error message using `fprintf` if an error occurs.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
