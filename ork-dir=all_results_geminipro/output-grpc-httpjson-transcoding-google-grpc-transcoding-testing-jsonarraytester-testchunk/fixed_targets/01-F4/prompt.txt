Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "grpc_transcoding/testing/json_array_tester.h"

#include "test_common.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>

namespace google {
namespace grpc {
namespace transcoding {
namespace testing {
namespace {

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  JsonArrayTester tester;

  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    // Add a few chucks of data to the input stream.
    for (int i = 0; i < provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 5); i++) {
      tester.TestChunk(provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100));
    }

    // Handle end of input or error due to malformed bytes.
    if (tester.Finished()) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
} // namespace
} // namespace testing
} // namespace transcoding
} // namespace grpc
} // namespace google
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `JsonArrayTester` class is declared in the `grpc_transcoding::testing` namespace, but the code does not include the necessary header file to use this class.

To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include "grpc_transcoding/testing/json_array_tester.h"
```

2. The `FuzzedDataProvider` class is declared in the `fuzzer` namespace, but the code does not include the necessary header file to use this class.

To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
```

3. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, but the code does not include the necessary header file to use this linkage.

To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include <cstddef>
```

4. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, but the code does not include the necessary header file to use this linkage.

To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
```

After making these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
