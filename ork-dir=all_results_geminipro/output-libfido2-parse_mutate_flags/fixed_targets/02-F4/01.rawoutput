```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "parse_mutate_flags.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string opt = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int mutate_flags = 0;
  parse_mutate_flags(const_cast<char*>(opt.c_str()), &mutate_flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `parse_mutate_flags` function was declared in the `parse_mutate_flags.h` header file, but the header file was not included in the code. This caused the linker to complain about an undefined reference to the function.

To fix the issue, the `parse_mutate_flags.h` header file was included at the top of the file. This allowed the linker to find the declaration of the `parse_mutate_flags` function and resolve the undefined reference.

The fixed code should now compile and run without errors.
