Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

namespace rawspeed {

class VC5Decompressor {
public:
  void combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl(const VC5Decompressor *decompressor) const {
    // Do something
  }
};

}  // namespace rawspeed

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider data_provider(data, size);
  rawspeed::VC5Decompressor decompressor;
  decompressor.combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl(&decompressor);
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl` function is called with the `&decompressor` argument, which is a pointer to the `decompressor` object. This is the correct way to call the function, as it allows the function to access the member variables of the `decompressor` object.

The original code had a build error because the `combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl` function was not called inside the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. This has been fixed in the provided code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
