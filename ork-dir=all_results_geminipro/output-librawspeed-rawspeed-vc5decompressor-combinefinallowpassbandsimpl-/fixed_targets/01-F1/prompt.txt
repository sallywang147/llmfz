Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "rawspeed/rawspeed.h"
#include "rawspeed/rawspeed_defines.h"
#include "rawspeed/rawspeed_exceptions.h"
#include "rawspeed/rawspeed_image.h"
#include "rawspeed/rawspeed_types.h"

#include <cassert>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>

namespace rawspeed {

class VC5Decompressor {
public:
  void combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl(rawspeed::VC5Decompressor *) const {
    // This function is empty, but the fuzzer will still exercise the code
    // path that calls it.
  }
};

} // namespace rawspeed

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  assert(data);

  try {
    const rawspeed::Buffer b(data, rawspeed::implicit_cast<rawspeed::Buffer::size_type>(size));
    const rawspeed::DataBuffer db(b, rawspeed::Endianness::little);
    rawspeed::ByteStream bs(db);

    rawspeed::VC5Decompressor decompressor;
    decompressor.combineFinalLowpassBandsImpl(&decompressor);
  } catch (const rawspeed::RawspeedException &) {
    return 0;
  }

  __builtin_unreachable();
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
