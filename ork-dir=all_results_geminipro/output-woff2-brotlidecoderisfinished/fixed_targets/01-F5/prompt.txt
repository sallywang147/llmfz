Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "brotli/decode.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  BrotliDecoderState *s = BrotliDecoderCreateInstance(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (s == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  const size_t kBufferSize = 1024;
  std::vector<uint8_t> output_buffer(kBufferSize);
  size_t total_output = 0;
  while (BrotliDecoderIsFinished(s) == 0) {
    const size_t next_size =
        stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, stream.remaining_bytes());
    auto next_input = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(next_size);
    BrotliDecoderResult result = BrotliDecoderDecompressStream(
        s, next_input.data(), next_input.size(), &output_buffer[0],
        &output_buffer[0] + kBufferSize, &total_output, nullptr);
    if (result != BROTLI_DECODER_RESULT_NEEDS_MORE_INPUT) {
      break;
    }
  }
  BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance(s);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `#include` directive for `brotli/decode.h` was missing the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is necessary because the Brotli library is written in C, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to use the C calling convention when calling the Brotli functions.

2. The `BrotliDecoderDecompressStream` function was missing the `nullptr` argument for the `output_used` parameter. This parameter is used to return the number of bytes that were actually written to the output buffer, and it must be initialized to `nullptr` before calling the function.

The fixed code includes the `extern "C"` wrapper for the `brotli/decode.h` header and adds the `nullptr` argument to the `BrotliDecoderDecompressStream` function call. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
