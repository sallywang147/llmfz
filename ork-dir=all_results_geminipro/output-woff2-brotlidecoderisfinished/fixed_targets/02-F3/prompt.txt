Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <brotli/decode.h>

extern "C" {
#include <brotli/decode.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  BrotliDecoderState* state = BrotliDecoderCreateInstance(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (state == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    size_t consumed;
    BrotliDecoderResult result = BrotliDecoderDecompressStream(
        state, &stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes(), &consumed, nullptr);
    if (result != BROTLI_DECODER_RESULT_SUCCESS &&
        result != BROTLI_DECODER_RESULT_NEEDS_MORE_INPUT) {
      BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance(state);
      return 0;
    }
    if (BrotliDecoderIsFinished(state)) {
      BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance(state);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance(state);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The `#include <brotli/decode.h>` directive was included twice, once inside and once outside the `extern "C" {}` block. This is incorrect because the header file should only be included once.
* The `BrotliDecoderCreateInstance`, `BrotliDecoderDecompressStream`, `BrotliDecoderIsFinished`, and `BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance` functions were not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for them to be visible to the C++ compiler.

The fixed code addresses these issues by including the `brotli/decode.h` header file only once, inside the `extern "C" {}` block, and by declaring the Brotli decoder functions as `extern "C"`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
