Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <nl/wpantund/spinel.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int event = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::vector<uint8_t> args = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskScan task;
  task.vprocess_event(&task, event,
                      reinterpret_cast<struct __va_list_tag*>(args.data()));
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `std::vector` library is used, but it is not included in the code.
2. The `va_list` library is used, but it is not included in the code.

The fixed code includes the necessary libraries and fixes the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
