Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "wpantund.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskScan* task =
      new nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskScan();
  const int event = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const struct __va_list_tag* args = stream.ConsumeVaList();
  int result = task->vprocess_event(task, event, args);
  delete task;
  return result;
}
```

In this fixed code, the `ConsumeVaList()` method of `FuzzedDataProvider` is used to consume the variable arguments (`__va_list_tag*`) from the input data. This is necessary because the `vprocess_event()` function takes a variable number of arguments.

The original code had a few issues:

1. It was missing the `ConsumeVaList()` method to consume the variable arguments from the input data.
2. The `args` pointer was initialized to `nullptr`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to the variable arguments consumed from the input data.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
