Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/pugixml.hpp"
#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(Data, Size);
  std::string text = fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString(1024);

#ifndef PUGIXML_NO_EXCEPTIONS
  try
#endif
  {
    pugi::xml_document doc;
    doc.load_string(text.c_str());

    size_t node_count = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < node_count; ++i) {
      std::vector<uint8_t> xml_buffer = fdp.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
      pugi::xml_parse_result result = doc.append_buffer_inplace(xml_buffer.data(), xml_buffer.size(), pugi::parse_full);
    }
  }
#ifndef PUGIXML_NO_EXCEPTIONS
  catch (pugi::xpath_exception &) {
  }
#endif
  return 0;
}
```
The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `append_buffer` method was replaced with `append_buffer_inplace`. This is because the `append_buffer` method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Pugixml.
2. The `pugi::parse_full` flag was added to the `append_buffer_inplace` method call. This flag is necessary to ensure that the XML data is parsed completely.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
