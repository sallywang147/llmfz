Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the function `externalEntityInitProcessor2` is not defined. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "expat.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char test_file[] = "libfuzzer.xml";

  FILE *fp = fopen(test_file, "wb");
  if (!fp)
    return 0;
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  XML_Parser parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL);
  XML_SetExternalEntityRefHandler(parser, externalEntityInitProcessor2);
  if (!XML_ParseFile(parser, test_file)) {
    return 1;
  }

  remove(test_file);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
