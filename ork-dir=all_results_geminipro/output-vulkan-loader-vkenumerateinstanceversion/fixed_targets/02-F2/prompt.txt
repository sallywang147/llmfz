Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <vulkan/vulkan.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  int version;
  vkEnumerateInstanceVersion(&version);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The header `#include <vulkan/vulkan.h>` was missing. This header is necessary to use the Vulkan API.
2. The function `vkEnumerateInstanceVersion` is declared in the Vulkan header, but it is not defined in the code. This means that the linker will not be able to find the definition of the function when it tries to build the program.

The fixed code includes the necessary header and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header is written in C and not C++. This is necessary because the Vulkan API is written in C.

The fixed code also defines the function `vkEnumerateInstanceVersion`. This is done by simply adding the function declaration to the code.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
