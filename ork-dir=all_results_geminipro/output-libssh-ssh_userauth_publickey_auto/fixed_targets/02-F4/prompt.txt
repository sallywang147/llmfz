Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <libssh/libssh.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  ssh_session session = ssh_new();
  if (session == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error creating session: %s\n", ssh_get_error(session));
    return 0;
  }

  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");
  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_PORT, "22");

  int rc = ssh_connect(session);
  if (rc != SSH_OK) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error connecting to server: %s\n", ssh_get_error(session));
    ssh_free(session);
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t username_length = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  size_t passphrase_length = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> username_bytes = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(username_length);
  std::vector<uint8_t> passphrase_bytes = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(passphrase_length);
  char* username = reinterpret_cast<char*>(username_bytes.data());
  char* passphrase = reinterpret_cast<char*>(passphrase_bytes.data());

  rc = ssh_userauth_publickey_auto(session, username, passphrase);
  if (rc != SSH_AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error authenticating with public key: %s\n", ssh_get_error(session));
  }

  ssh_disconnect(session);
  ssh_free(session);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. `ssh_new()` was not assigned to `session`, resulting in a dangling pointer.
2. `ssh_connect()` was not assigned to `rc`, making it impossible to check for errors.
3. The `ssh_userauth_publickey_auto()` function was called without checking if the connection was successful.

The fixed code addresses these issues and should now work as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
