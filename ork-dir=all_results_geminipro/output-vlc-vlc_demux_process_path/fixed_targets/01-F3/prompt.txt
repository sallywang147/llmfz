Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif

#include "src/input/demux-run.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv);
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size);

static struct vlc_run_args args;
static libvlc_instance_t *vlc;

extern "C" {
#include <libavutil/avutil.h>
#include <libavformat/avformat.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {
  (void)argc;
  (void)argv;

  vlc_run_args_init(&args);
  vlc = libvlc_create(&args);

  return vlc ? 0 : -1;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char *path = str.c_str();
  vlc_demux_process_path(&args, path);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The code includes the header `src/input/demux-run.h` which is a private header of VLC and is not available to users.
2. The code uses the function `vlc_run_args_init` which is also a private function of VLC and is not available to users.
3. The code uses the function `libvlc_create` which is a private function of VLC and is not available to users.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified to use only public headers and functions of VLC.

The following changes have been made:

1. The header `src/input/demux-run.h` has been removed.
2. The function `vlc_run_args_init` has been replaced with the public function `libvlc_new`.
3. The function `libvlc_create` has been replaced with the public function `libvlc_create_new`.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
