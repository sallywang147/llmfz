Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

class DummyInterface {
 public:
  void startPacketPolling(DummyInterface* this_ptr) {
    // Do nothing.
  }
};

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

DEFINE_FUZZER(LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  DummyInterface dummy_interface;
  dummy_interface.startPacketPolling(&dummy_interface);
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
