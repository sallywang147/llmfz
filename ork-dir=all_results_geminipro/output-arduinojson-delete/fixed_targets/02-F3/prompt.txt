Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <ArduinoJson.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  JsonDocument doc;
  DeserializationError error = deserializeMsgPack(doc, data, size);
  if (!error) {
    std::string json;
    serializeMsgPack(doc, json);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The fix is to include the `<stdlib.h>` header, which contains the `free` function that is used by the `ArduinoJson` library. This is necessary because the `ArduinoJson` library uses the `free` function to free memory that it allocates, and the `free` function is not declared in the `stddef.h` header. By including the `<stdlib.h>` header, we are ensuring that the `free` function is available to the `ArduinoJson` library.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::VariantSlot::operator delete(char * , char * )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::VariantSlot::operator delete(char * , char * )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
