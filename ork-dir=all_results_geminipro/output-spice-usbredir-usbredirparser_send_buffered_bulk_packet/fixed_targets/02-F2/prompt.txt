Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "usbredirparser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "usbredirparser_fuzzer.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct usbredirparser* parser = usbredirparser_new();
  if (parser == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const size_t bulk_packet_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      1, 1024);
  char* bulk_packet = new char[bulk_packet_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(bulk_packet, bulk_packet_size);

  const int endpoint_number = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 16);
  const int transfer_id = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);

  struct usb_redir_start_bulk_receiving_header header;
  header.stream_id = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  header.endpoint_number = endpoint_number;
  header.transfer_id = transfer_id;
  header.length = bulk_packet_size;

  usbredirparser_send_buffered_bulk_packet(parser, bulk_packet_size, &header,
                                           bulk_packet, endpoint_number);

  usbredirparser_free(parser);
  delete[] bulk_packet;

  return 0;
}
```

The provided code has the following issues:

- The header file `usbredirparser_fuzzer.h` is not included. This header file contains the declaration of the `usbredirparser_send_buffered_bulk_packet` function.

To fix this issue, the following line should be added to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "usbredirparser_fuzzer.h"
```

- The function `usbredirparser_send_buffered_bulk_packet` is not declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C++ file and is being called from a C program.

To fix this issue, the following line should be added to the top of the file:

```c++
extern "C" {
```

- The function `usbredirparser_send_buffered_bulk_packet` is not defined. This is because the function is declared in the header file `usbredirparser_fuzzer.h`, but it is not defined in any of the source files.

To fix this issue, the following function definition should be added to one of the source files:

```c++
void usbredirparser_send_buffered_bulk_packet(struct usbredirparser* parser,
                                             size_t length,
                                             const struct usb_redir_start_bulk_receiving_header* header,
                                             const char* data, int endpoint_number) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

After making these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
