Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "fuzz.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc_p ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED, char ***argv_p ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED) { return xsltFuzzXPathInit(); }

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const char *data, size_t size) {
  xmlXPathObjectPtr xpathObj = xsltFuzzXPath(data, size);
  xmlDocPtr doc = xsltFuzzDoc(data, size);
  xmlDocPtr ret = xsltProfileStylesheet(xsltFuzzStylesheet(data, size), doc, nullptr, nullptr);
  xsltFuzzFreeDoc(doc);
  xsltFuzzFreeDoc(ret);
  xsltFuzzXPathFreeObject(xpathObj);

  return 0;
}

DEFINE_FUZZER(LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput)
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `fuzz.h` is not included.
2. The function `xsltFuzzXPathInit` is not defined.
3. The function `xsltFuzzXPath` is not defined.
4. The function `xsltFuzzDoc` is not defined.
5. The function `xsltFuzzStylesheet` is not defined.
6. The function `xsltProfileStylesheet` is not defined.
7. The function `xsltFuzzFreeDoc` is not defined.
8. The function `xsltFuzzXPathFreeObject` is not defined.

To fix these issues, the following changes are made:

1. The header file `fuzz.h` is included.
2. The function `xsltFuzzXPathInit` is defined.
3. The function `xsltFuzzXPath` is defined.
4. The function `xsltFuzzDoc` is defined.
5. The function `xsltFuzzStylesheet` is defined.
6. The function `xsltProfileStylesheet` is defined.
7. The function `xsltFuzzFreeDoc` is defined.
8. The function `xsltFuzzXPathFreeObject` is defined.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
