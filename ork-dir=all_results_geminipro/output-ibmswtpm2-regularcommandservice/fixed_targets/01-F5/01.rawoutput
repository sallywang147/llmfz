```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "RegularCommandService.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int PortNumber = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  RegularCommandService(&PortNumber);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `RegularCommandService.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to be unable to find the definition of the function `RegularCommandService`.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the header file `RegularCommandService.h` with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The function `RegularCommandService` is not declared as `extern "C"`. This causes the linker to be unable to find the definition of the function `RegularCommandService`.

To fix this issue, we need to declare the function `RegularCommandService` as `extern "C"`.

The fixed code is shown above.
