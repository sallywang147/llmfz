Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "RegularCommandService.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int PortNumber = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  RegularCommandService(&PortNumber);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `RegularCommandService.h` is not included.
2. The function `RegularCommandService` is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ to link to a C function.

To fix these issues, we:

1. Include the header file `RegularCommandService.h`.
2. Wrap the `#include` directive for `RegularCommandService.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
3. Declare the function `RegularCommandService` as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should compile and link successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
