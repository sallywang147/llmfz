#include <stdio.h>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "RegularCommandService.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int PortNumber = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  RegularCommandService(&PortNumber);

}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `RegularCommandService.h` is not included.
2. The function `RegularCommandService` is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ to link to a C function.

To fix these issues, we:

1. Include the header file `RegularCommandService.h`.
2. Wrap the `#include` directive for `RegularCommandService.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
3. Declare the function `RegularCommandService` as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should compile and link successfully.
