Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <vector>

#include "archive.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libarchive/archive.h>
#include <libarchive/archive_entry.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *buf, size_t len) {
  int ret;
  ssize_t r;
  struct archive *a = archive_read_new();

  archive_read_support_filter_all(a);
  archive_read_support_format_all(a);

  std::vector<uint8_t> buffer(len, 0);
  memcpy(buffer.data(), buf, len);
  Buffer buffer_struct = {buffer.data(), len};
  archive_read_open(a, &buffer_struct, NULL, reader_callback, NULL);

  std::vector<uint8_t> data_buffer(getpagesize(), 0);
  struct archive_entry *entry;
  while (1) {
    ret = archive_read_next_header(a, &entry);
    if (ret == ARCHIVE_EOF || ret == ARCHIVE_FATAL)
      break;
    if (ret == ARCHIVE_RETRY)
      continue;
    while ((r = archive_read_data(a, data_buffer.data(), data_buffer.size())) > 0)
      ;
    if (r == ARCHIVE_FATAL)
      break;

    // Call the function to fuzz.
    char *acl_text = archive_entry_acl_text(entry, ARCHIVE_ENTRY_ACL_TYPE_ACCESS);
    if (acl_text != nullptr)
      free(acl_text);
  }

  archive_read_free(a);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- In the `archive_entry_acl_text` function, the second argument is changed from `0` to `ARCHIVE_ENTRY_ACL_TYPE_ACCESS`. This ensures that the access control list (ACL) text is retrieved for the access ACL type, which is the most common type of ACL.

- The `archive_read_open` function is called with the correct arguments. The `reader_callback` function is passed as the fourth argument, and the `NULL` argument is passed as the fifth argument.

- The `archive_read_next_header` function is called with the correct arguments. The `entry` argument is passed as the second argument, and the `NULL` argument is passed as the third argument.

- The `archive_read_data` function is called with the correct arguments. The `data_buffer.data()` argument is passed as the second argument, and the `data_buffer.size()` argument is passed as the third argument.

- The `archive_read_free` function is called with the correct argument. The `a` argument is passed as the argument.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
