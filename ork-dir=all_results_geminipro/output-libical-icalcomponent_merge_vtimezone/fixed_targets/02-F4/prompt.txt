Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <libical/ical.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libical/icalparser.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *ical_string1 = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ical_string1, data, size);
  ical_string1[size] = '\0';

  char *ical_string2 = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ical_string2, data, size);
  ical_string2[size] = '\0';

  icalcomponent *ical1 = icalcomponent_new_from_string(ical_string1);
  icalcomponent *ical2 = icalcomponent_new_from_string(ical_string2);
  icalarray *tzids = icalarray_new(icalcomponent_get_icalcomponent_type(ical1));
  if (ical1 != NULL && ical2 != NULL && tzids != NULL) {
    icalcomponent_merge_vtimezone(ical1, ical2, tzids);
  }
  icalcomponent_free(ical1);
  icalcomponent_free(ical2);
  icalarray_free(tzids);
  free(ical_string1);
  free(ical_string2);

  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the function `icalcomponent_new_from_string` is not defined. This function is declared in the header file `icalparser.h`, which is not included in the original code. To fix the error, we need to include this header file using `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is properly linked.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file and wraps the inclusion with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is properly linked.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
