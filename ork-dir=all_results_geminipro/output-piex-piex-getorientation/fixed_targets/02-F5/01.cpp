The issue in the original code was that it was not catching exceptions properly. The `catch (...)` block was catching all exceptions, including `std::exception`s. This meant that any `std::exception`s that were thrown would not be printed to the console.

To fix this, the `catch (...)` block was replaced with a `catch (const std::exception &e)` block. This block will only catch `std::exception`s, and it will print the exception's message to the console.

The `catch (...)` block was also replaced with a `catch (...)` block. This block will catch all other exceptions, and it will print a message to the console indicating that an unknown exception was caught.
