Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <boost/regex/regex_parser_impl.hpp>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(Data, Size);
  // First value is length of the regex string
  size_t regex_length = fuzzed_data.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  // Second value is regexp string whose length is `regex_length`
  std::wstring regex_string = fuzzed_data.ConsumeWString(regex_length);
  try {
    boost::re_detail_500::basic_regex_parser<wchar_t, boost::c_regex_traits<wchar_t> > parser;
    parser.parse(regex_string);
  } catch (const std::runtime_error &) {
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `parse_basic` method of `basic_regex_parser` is deprecated and should be replaced with `parse`.
2. The `parse` method takes a `std::wstring` as an argument, but the original code is passing a `wchar_t*`.

The fixed code addresses these issues by using the `parse` method and passing a `std::wstring` to it.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
