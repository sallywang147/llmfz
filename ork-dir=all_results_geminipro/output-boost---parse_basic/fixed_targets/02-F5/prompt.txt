Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <boost/regex/regex_parser_impl.hpp>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <string>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(Data, Size);
  // First value is length of the regex string
  size_t regex_length = fuzzed_data.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  // Second value is regexp string whose length is `regex_length`
  std::wstring regex_string = fuzzed_data.ConsumeWString(regex_length);
  try {
    boost::re_detail_500::basic_regex_parser<wchar_t, boost::c_regex_traits<wchar_t> > parser;
    parser.parse_basic(&parser);
  } catch (const std::runtime_error &) {
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'std::string::string(std::wstring const&)'
```
This error is because the `std::string` constructor that takes a `std::wstring` as an argument is not declared in the global namespace. To fix this, we need to include the `<string>` header file, which declares this constructor.

We also need to wrap the `#include <string>` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the `std::string` class is defined in the C++ standard library, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as a C function. This is necessary to ensure that the linker can find the `std::string` class when linking the program.

After making these changes, the program should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
