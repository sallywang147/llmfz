Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include "gnutls/gnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  gnutls_global_init();
  gnutls_session_t session;
  gnutls_init(&session, GNUTLS_SERVER);
  gnutls_priority_set_direct(session, "NORMAL", NULL);
  gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials(&session);
  gnutls_credentials_set(session, GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE, gnutls_certificate_get(session));

  gnutls_transport_set_ptr(session, (gnutls_transport_ptr_t)data, size);
  gnutls_handshake(session);
  gnutls_deinit(session);
  gnutls_global_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the function `handshake_server` is not called, which is causing the build error. To fix this, the function `gnutls_handshake` is called instead, which performs the server-side handshake.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
