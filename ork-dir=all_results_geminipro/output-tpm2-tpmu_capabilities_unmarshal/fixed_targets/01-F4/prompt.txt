Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" {
#include "Capabilities.h"
#include "ExecCommand_fp.h"
#include "Implementation.h"
#include "Manufacture_fp.h"
#include "Platform.h"
#include "Startup_fp.h"
#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "_TPM_Init_fp.h"
#include "tpm_types.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  union TPMU_CAPABILITIES target;
  int selector = 0;

  /* Initialize TPM state. */
  _plat__Signal_PowerOn();
  _plat__NVEnable(NULL);
  assert(TPM_Manufacture(1) == 0);
  _plat__NVDisable();
  _TPM_Init();
  _plat__SetNvAvail();
  _plat__Signal_PhysicalPresenceOn();

  /* Unmarshal fuzzed data. */
  TPMU_CAPABILITIES_Unmarshal(&target, (char **)&data, (int *)&size, selector);
  return 0; /* Non-zero return values are reserved for future use. */
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

1. The function `TPM_Manufacture` is declared in the header file `Manufacture_fp.h`, but it is not defined in any of the included header files.

2. The function `_TPM_Init` is declared in the header file `_TPM_Init_fp.h`, but it is not defined in any of the included header files.

To fix these issues, you need to include the header files that define these functions. In this case, you need to include the header file `Implementation.h`.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" {
#include "Capabilities.h"
#include "ExecCommand_fp.h"
#include "Implementation.h"
#include "Manufacture_fp.h"
#include "Platform.h"
#include "Startup_fp.h"
#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "_TPM_Init_fp.h"
#include "tpm_types.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  union TPMU_CAPABILITIES target;
  int selector = 0;

  /* Initialize TPM state. */
  _plat__Signal_PowerOn();
  _plat__NVEnable(NULL);
  assert(TPM_Manufacture(1) == 0);
  _plat__NVDisable();
  _TPM_Init();
  _plat__SetNvAvail();
  _plat__Signal_PhysicalPresenceOn();

  /* Unmarshal fuzzed data. */
  TPMU_CAPABILITIES_Unmarshal(&target, (char **)&data, (int *)&size, selector);
  return 0; /* Non-zero return values are reserved for future use. */
}
```

With these changes, the code should build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
