Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "zdict.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t dict_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1 << 20);
  char* dict = new char[dict_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(dict, dict_size);
  const size_t train_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1 << 20);
  char* train = new char[train_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(train, train_size);
  size_t train_result_size = 0;
  ZDICT_legacy_params_t params;
  memset(&params, 0, sizeof(params));
  params.compressionLevel = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 12);
  const size_t result = ZDICT_trainFromBuffer_legacy(
      dict, dict_size, train, &train_result_size, params.compressionLevel, &params);
  delete[] dict;
  delete[] train;
  return 0;
}
```
The fixed code:

1. Added the missing header file `#include <zdict.h>` which is required for the `ZDICT_trainFromBuffer_legacy` function.

2. Wrapped the `#include <zdict.h>` header with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the linker error. This is necessary because `zdict.h` contains C-style function declarations, and the C++ compiler expects C++-style function declarations. By wrapping the header with `extern "C" {}`, we tell the compiler to treat the functions declared in `zdict.h` as C-style functions.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
