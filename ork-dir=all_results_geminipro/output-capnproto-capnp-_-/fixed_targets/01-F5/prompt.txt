Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "serialize.h"
#include "test-util.h"
#include <capnp/test.capnp.h>
#include <kj/main.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" {
#include <capnp/message.h>
}

/* This is the entry point of a fuzz target to be used with libFuzzer
 * or another fuzz driver.
 * Such a fuzz driver is used by the autotools target capnp-llvm-fuzzer-testcase
 * when the environment variable LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE is defined
 * for instance LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE=-fsanitize=fuzzer for libFuzzer
 */
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  kj::ArrayPtr<const uint8_t> array(Data, Size);
  kj::ArrayInputStream ais(array);

  if (kj::none != kj::runCatchingExceptions([&]() {
        capnp::InputStreamMessageReader reader(ais);
        capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Reader reader_root = reader.getRoot<capnp::DynamicStruct>();
        capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Builder builder;
        capnp::_::checkDynamicTestMessage(reader_root, builder.asReader());
        kj::str(reader_root);
      })) {
    KJ_LOG(ERROR, "threw");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. In the line `capnp::_::checkDynamicTestMessage(reader.getRoot<capnp::DynamicStruct>(builder.asReader()));`, the `builder.asReader()` was replaced with `reader_root`. This is because `checkDynamicTestMessage()` expects a `capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Reader`, not a `capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Builder`.
2. In the line `kj::str(reader.getRoot<capnp::DynamicStruct>(builder.asReader()));`, the `builder.asReader()` was replaced with `reader_root`. This is because `kj::str()` expects a `capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Reader`, not a `capnp::_::DynamicStruct::Builder`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
