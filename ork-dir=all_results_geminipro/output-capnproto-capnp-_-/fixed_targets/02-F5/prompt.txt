Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <capnp/message.h>
#include <capnp/dynamic.h>
#include <capnp/test.capnp.h>
#include <kj/main.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

/* This is the entry point of a fuzz target to be used with libFuzzer
 * or another fuzz driver.
 * Such a fuzz driver is used by the autotools target capnp-llvm-fuzzer-testcase
 * when the environment variable LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE is defined
 * for instance LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE=-fsanitize=fuzzer for libFuzzer
 */
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  capnp::DynamicStruct::Builder builder = capnp::DynamicStruct::Builder::initEmpty();
  capnp::_::StructBuilder_init(builder);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary `stddef.h` header file, which defines the `size_t` type used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. The `extern "C" {}` block is used to wrap the `#include` directive for `stddef.h`, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
