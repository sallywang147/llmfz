Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "ivorbisfile.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  OggVorbis_File vf;
  int result = ov_open_memory(Data, Size, NULL, 0, &vf);
  if (result < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  int current_section = 0;
  char pcm[4096];
  long read_result;
  while (true) {
    read_result = ov_read(&vf, pcm, sizeof(pcm), &current_section);
    if (read_result <= 0 && read_result != OV_HOLE) {
      break;
    }
  }
  ov_clear(&vf);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `ivorbisfile.h` header file was not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions and variables, which need to be declared as `extern "C"` in order to be visible to the C++ compiler.

The corrected code wraps the `ivorbisfile.h` header file in `extern "C" {}`, which allows the C++ compiler to see the C functions and variables declared in the header file. This fixes the build error and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
