The issue with the original code was that the `ivorbisfile.h` header file was not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions and variables, which need to be declared as `extern "C"` in order to be visible to the C++ compiler.

The corrected code wraps the `ivorbisfile.h` header file in `extern "C" {}`, which allows the C++ compiler to see the C functions and variables declared in the header file. This fixes the build error and allows the code to compile successfully.
