Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "ivorbisfile.h"
}

#define INPUT_LIMIT 16384

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FILE *f = fmemopen((void *)Data, Size, "r");
  if (!f) {
    return 0;
  }
  OggVorbis_File vf;
  char initial[INPUT_LIMIT];
  size_t ibytes = Size > INPUT_LIMIT ? INPUT_LIMIT : Size;
  if (fread(initial, 1, ibytes, f) != ibytes) {
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
  }
  int result = ov_open_callbacks(f, &vf, NULL, 0, initial, ibytes);
  if (result < 0) {
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
  }
  ov_clear(&vf);
  fclose(f);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `ov_open` is used, but it is not defined in the included header file `ivorbisfile.h`.
2. The function `ov_open_callbacks` is not defined in the included header file `ivorbisfile.h`.

To fix these issues, the following changes are made:

1. The function `ov_open_callbacks` is used instead of `ov_open`.
2. The function `ov_open_callbacks` is defined in the header file `ivorbisfile.h`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
