Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is likely:

```
error: undefined reference to `vlc_run_args_init'
```

This is because the function `vlc_run_args_init` is declared in the header file `vlc/vlc.h`, but it is not defined in the source file. To fix this, we need to link the program with the VLC library, which contains the definition of `vlc_run_args_init`.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "vlc/vlc.h"

extern "C" {
#include "vlc/vlc.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct vlc_run_args args;
  vlc_run_args_init(&args);
  vlc_demux_process_memory(&args, (char *)data, size);
  return 0;
}
```

We also need to add the VLC library to the linker command line. This can be done by adding the following line to the Makefile:

```
LDFLAGS += -lvlc
```

This will tell the linker to link the program with the VLC library.

With these changes, the program should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
