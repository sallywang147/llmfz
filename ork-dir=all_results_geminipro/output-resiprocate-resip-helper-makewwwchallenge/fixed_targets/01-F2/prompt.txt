Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "resip/resip.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  resip::SipMessage* sip_message = nullptr;
  resip::Data* data_ptr = nullptr;
  bool bool_1 = stream.ConsumeBool();
  bool bool_2 = stream.ConsumeBool();
  std::string realm = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

  resip::SipMessage* result = resip::Helper::makeWWWChallenge(
      sip_message, data_ptr, bool_1, bool_2, realm);
  delete result;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
