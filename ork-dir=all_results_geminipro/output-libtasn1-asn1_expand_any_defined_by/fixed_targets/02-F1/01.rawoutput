The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `<asn1_fuzz.h>` and `<asn1_gen.h>` are not included with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the functions declared in these headers are not visible to the C++ compiler.

2. The function `asn1_expand_any_defined_by()` is not declared in any of the included header files. This causes a compiler error because the function is not known to the compiler.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The header files `<asn1_fuzz.h>` and `<asn1_gen.h>` are included with `extern "C" {}`. This makes the functions declared in these headers visible to the C++ compiler.

2. The function `asn1_expand_any_defined_by()` is declared in the header file `<asn1_fuzz.h>`. This makes the function known to the compiler.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
