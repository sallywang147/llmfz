Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include <asn1_fuzz.h>
#include <asn1_gen.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t num_nodes = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  struct asn1_node_st** nodes = new struct asn1_node_st*[num_nodes];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_nodes; i++) {
    nodes[i] = asn1_fuzz_node_value(stream);
  }
  struct asn1_node_st* element = nullptr;
  int ret = asn1_expand_any_defined_by(nodes[0], &element);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_nodes; i++) {
    asn1_fuzz_node_free(nodes[i]);
  }
  delete[] nodes;
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `<asn1_fuzz.h>` and `<asn1_gen.h>` are not included with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the functions declared in these headers are not visible to the C++ compiler.

2. The function `asn1_expand_any_defined_by()` is not declared in any of the included header files. This causes a compiler error because the function is not known to the compiler.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The header files `<asn1_fuzz.h>` and `<asn1_gen.h>` are included with `extern "C" {}`. This makes the functions declared in these headers visible to the C++ compiler.

2. The function `asn1_expand_any_defined_by()` is declared in the header file `<asn1_fuzz.h>`. This makes the function known to the compiler.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
