Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "buf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  struct Buf* buf = buf_new(buf_size);
  if (buf == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const size_t fmt_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  char* fmt = static_cast<char*>(malloc(fmt_size));
  if (fmt == nullptr) {
    buf_free(buf);
    return 0;
  }
  stream.ConsumeBytes(fmt, fmt_size);

  const size_t s_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  char* s = static_cast<char*>(malloc(s_size));
  if (s == nullptr) {
    buf_free(buf);
    free(fmt);
    return 0;
  }
  stream.ConsumeBytes(s, s_size);

  buf_prints(buf, fmt, s);

  buf_free(buf);
  free(fmt);
  free(s);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that the header `buf.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `buf.h` header contains C functions, and the C++ compiler expects C++ functions. By wrapping the header with `extern "C" {}`, we tell the compiler to treat the functions in the header as C functions.

The corrected code includes the `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `buf.h` header, which resolves the build issue and allows the program to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
