Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "buf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/Format.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Buf *buf = buf_new(size);
  if (buf == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  buf_resetw(buf);

  const char *fmt = (const char *)data;
  size_t fmt_len = strnlen((const char *)data, size);
  buf_puts(buf, fmt, fmt_len);

  const char *s = (const char *)(data + fmt_len);
  size_t s_len = size - fmt_len;
  buf_puts(buf, s, s_len);

  buf_prints(buf, "%s", buf->buf);

  buf_free(buf);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'llvm::format_v(const char*, llvm::ArrayRef<llvm::StringRef>)'
```

The error message indicates that the function `llvm::format_v` is not defined. This function is declared in the header file `llvm/Support/Format.h`. To fix the error, we need to include this header file in the code.

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared with `extern "C"`. This is necessary to ensure that the function is properly linked when the code is compiled.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This should fix the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
