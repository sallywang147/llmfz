Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <gssapi/gssapi.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);

  gss_cred_id_t cred_handle = GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL;
  gss_OID_desc_struct mech_type = {0, 0};
  gss_name_t name = GSS_C_NO_NAME;
  int initiator_lifetime = 0;
  int acceptor_lifetime = 0;
  int cred_usage = 0;
  OM_uint32 minor_status = 0;

  // Consume the input data and set the input parameters.
  std::vector<uint8_t> cred_handle_bytes = fdp.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  cred_handle = (gss_cred_id_t)cred_handle_bytes.data();

  std::vector<uint8_t> mech_type_oid = fdp.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  mech_type.length = mech_type_oid.size();
  mech_type.elements = mech_type_oid.data();

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(&minor_status, cred_handle, &mech_type, &name, &initiator_lifetime, &acceptor_lifetime, &cred_usage);

  // Consume the remaining input data.
  std::vector<uint8_t> remaining_bytes = fdp.ConsumeRemainingBytes();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `gss_inquire_cred_by_mech` function takes an `OM_uint32` as its `minor_status` argument, but the code uses an `int`. This can lead to undefined behavior.
2. The `gss_inquire_cred_by_mech` function returns an `OM_uint32` status code, but the code does not check this status code. This can lead to the function returning an error without the code being aware of it.

The fixed code uses the correct type for the `minor_status` argument and checks the status code returned by `gss_inquire_cred_by_mech`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
