Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <gssapi.h>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <stdint.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  OM_uint32 minor_status;
  gss_cred_id_t cred_handle = GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL;
  gss_OID_desc_struct mech_type = {0, 0};
  gss_name_t name = GSS_C_NO_NAME;
  int initiator_lifetime = 0;
  int acceptor_lifetime = 0;
  int cred_usage = 0;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  void *data_ptr = bytes.data();

  gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(&minor_status, cred_handle, &mech_type, &name, &initiator_lifetime,
                          &acceptor_lifetime, &cred_usage);

  gss_release_cred(&minor_status, &cred_handle);
  gss_release_name(&minor_status, &name);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. Added `gss_release_cred` and `gss_release_name` to release the allocated memory for `cred_handle` and `name`.

2. Removed the `return 0;` statement before the `gss_release_cred` and `gss_release_name` calls. This ensures that the memory is released before the function returns.

3. Added `extern "C"` before the `#include <stdint.h>` directive. This is necessary because `stdint.h` is a C header file, and the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared as a C function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
