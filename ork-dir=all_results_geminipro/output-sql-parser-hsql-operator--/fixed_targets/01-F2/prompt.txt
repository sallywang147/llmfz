Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ColumnType.h"
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  ColumnType *column_type = new ColumnType(input);
  std::stringstream stream;
  stream << column_type;
  delete column_type;
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

- Replaced `new std::ostream()` with `std::stringstream stream;` to create a `std::stringstream` object named `stream`.
- Used `stream << column_type;` to write the `ColumnType` object to the `stream`.
- Removed the deletion of `stream` since it is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `std::ostream * hsql::operator<<(std::ostream * stream, struct hsql::ColumnType * column_type)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `std::ostream * hsql::operator<<(std::ostream * stream, struct hsql::ColumnType * column_type)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
