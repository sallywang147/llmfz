Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ColumnType.h"
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  ColumnType *column_type = new ColumnType(input);
  std::stringstream stream;
  stream << *column_type;
  delete column_type;
  return 0;
}

// Define the operator<< function for ColumnType
std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &stream, const ColumnType &column_type) {
  stream << column_type.ToString();
  return stream;
}
```

Changes made:

- Removed the `extern "C"` keyword from the definition of the `operator<<` function. This is because the function is not being called from C code, but from C++ code.
- Made the `operator<<` function take a `const ColumnType &` reference as its argument to avoid copying the `ColumnType` object.
- Used `column_type.ToString()` to convert the `ColumnType` object to a string and write it to the stream.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
