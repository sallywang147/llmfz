Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <iconv.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string src = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string from_codeset = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string to_codeset = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const bool transliterate = stream.ConsumeBool();
  const int handler = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  char* result = str_iconveha(const_cast<char*>(src.c_str()),
                             const_cast<char*>(from_codeset.c_str()),
                             const_cast<char*>(to_codeset.c_str()),
                             transliterate, handler);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `iconv.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `iconv.h` header is written in C, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is written in C++. By wrapping the `iconv.h` header with `extern "C" {}`, we are telling the compiler that the functions and variables in the header are written in C, and not in C++.

The corrected code includes the `iconv.h` header wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which fixes the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
