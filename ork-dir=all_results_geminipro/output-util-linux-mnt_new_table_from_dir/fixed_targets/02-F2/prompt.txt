Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include <mntent.h>

extern "C" {
#include <mntent.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string dir_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mnt_new_table_from_dir(const_cast<char*>(dir_name.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

The issue here is that the `mntent.h` header is included twice: once with the `#include <mntent.h>` directive and again with the `extern "C" { #include <mntent.h> }` directive. This causes a compiler error because the `mntent.h` header defines multiple symbols with the same name.

To fix this, the `#include <mntent.h>` directive can be removed, since the `extern "C" { #include <mntent.h> }` directive is sufficient to include the header and make its symbols visible to the C++ code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
