Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "get_quant_level.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const int method = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  get_quant_level(method);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The header file `get_quant_level.h` was not included, which caused the build error "undefined reference to `get_quant_level`".
2. The function `get_quant_level` was not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ functions to be called from C code.

The fixed code includes the necessary header file and declares the `get_quant_level` function as `extern "C"`, which should resolve the build errors and allow the code to compile and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
