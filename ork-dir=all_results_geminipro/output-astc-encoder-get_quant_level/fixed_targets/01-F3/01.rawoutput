The build error is likely caused by the missing definition of the `get_quant_level` function. To fix this, we need to include the header file that contains the definition of this function.

The corrected code:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "get_quant_level.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const int method = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  get_quant_level(method);
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should build successfully and run as expected.
