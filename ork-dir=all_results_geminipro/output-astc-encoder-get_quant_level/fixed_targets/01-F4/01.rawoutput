```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "get_quant_level.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const int method = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  get_quant_level(method);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The header file `get_quant_level.h` was not included, which caused the build error "undefined reference to `get_quant_level`".
2. The function `get_quant_level` was not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ functions to be called from C code.

The fixed code includes the necessary header file and declares the `get_quant_level` function as `extern "C"`, which should resolve the build errors and allow the code to compile and run successfully.
