Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "resip/stack/transport.h"

extern "C" {
#include "resip/stack/sip_message.h"
#include "resip/stack/sip_parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t transport_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  resip::Transport* transport = new resip::Transport(transport_size);
  const size_t sip_message_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  resip::SipMessage* sip_message = new resip::SipMessage(sip_message_size);

  const std::string sip_data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  resip::SipParser::parse(sip_message, sip_data.c_str(), sip_data.size());

  bool result = transport->basicCheck(transport, sip_message);

  delete sip_message;
  delete transport;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include "resip/stack/transport.h"` is missing. This header is necessary for the `resip::Transport` class to be used.
2. The header `#include "resip/stack/sip_message.h"` is missing. This header is necessary for the `resip::SipMessage` class to be used.
3. The header `#include "resip/stack/sip_parser.h"` is missing. This header is necessary for the `resip::SipParser::parse()` function to be used.

To fix the code, we need to add the missing headers. We also need to wrap the `#include` directives for the resip headers with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the object linking succeeds.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
