Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "resip/sip.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  resip::Transport transport;
  resip::SipMessage message;

  const std::string method = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  const std::string uri = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  const std::string version = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  message.setMethod(method);
  message.setUri(uri);
  message.setVersion(version);

  const std::string header_name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  const std::string header_value = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  message.addHeader(header_name, header_value);

  const std::string body = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  message.setBody(body);

  // Fix: Check the message before sending it.
  if (!message.check()) {
    return 0;
  }

  transport.basicCheck(&transport, &message);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. Added a check to ensure the message is valid before sending it. This is done by calling the `message.check()` method. If the message is invalid, the function returns immediately, preventing a crash.

2. The `resip::Transport::basicCheck()` function is called with the correct arguments. Previously, the `transport` pointer was passed twice, which is incorrect.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
