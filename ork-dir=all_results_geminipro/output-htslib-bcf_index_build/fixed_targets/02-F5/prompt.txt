Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <htslib/hts.h>

extern "C" {
#include <htslib/kseq.h>
#include <htslib/sam.h>
#include <htslib/bcf.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) return 0;
  char *fn = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(fn, data, size);
  fn[size] = '\0';

  // Pick a random min_shift value.
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int min_shift = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 100);

  htsFile *fp = hts_open(fn, "r");
  if (fp == NULL) {
    free(fn);
    return 0;
  }
  bcf_hdr_t *hdr = bcf_hdr_read(fp);
  hts_close(fp);
  if (hdr == NULL) {
    free(fn);
    return 0;
  }

  bcf_index_build(fn, min_shift);
  free(fn);
  bcf_hdr_destroy(hdr);
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the following changes were made:

1. Included the necessary header file `<htslib/vcf.h>` for the `bcf_hdr_read()` and `bcf_hdr_destroy()` functions.
2. Added a check to ensure that the file can be opened successfully before attempting to read the header.
3. Added a check to ensure that the header is not `NULL` before attempting to build the index.
4. Closed the file after reading the header.
5. Destroyed the header after building the index.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
