Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fmt/core.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer-common.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1)
    return 0;

  // Always use a fixed location of the data.
  static_assert(sizeof(size_t) <= fixed_size, "fixed size is too small");
  if (size <= fixed_size + 1)
    return 0;

  const size_t args = assign_from_buf<size_t>(data);
  data += fixed_size;
  size -= fixed_size;

  // data is already allocated separately in libFuzzer so reading past the end
  // will most likely be detected anyway.
  const std::string format_str = as_chars(data, size);

  // Use a fixed file pointer.
  static FILE *f = fopen("/dev/null", "w");

  fmt::v10::detail::value values[args];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < args; ++i) {
    values[i].type = fmt::v10::detail::value_type::int64;
    values[i].int64_value = 0;
  }

  fmt::v10::vprint(f, const_cast<char *>(format_str.c_str()), args, 0, values);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `fmt::v10::vprint` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file for the `fmt::v10::vprint` function. In this case, we need to include the `<fmt/core.h>` header file.

2. The `assign_from_buf` and `as_chars` functions are not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file for the `assign_from_buf` and `as_chars` functions. In this case, we need to include the `fuzzer-common.h` header file.

After including the necessary header files, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
