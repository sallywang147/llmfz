Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <apr_pools.h>

extern "C" {
#include <apr-1/apr_pools.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  apr_pool_t* pool = nullptr;
  apr_pool_create(&pool, nullptr);
  event_hooks(pool);
  apr_pool_destroy(pool);
  return 0;
}

// Define the missing function `event_hooks`
extern "C" void event_hooks(apr_pool_t* pool) {
  // Add your custom event handling logic here
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Included the missing header file `apr-1/apr_pools.h` to resolve the undefined reference error.
2. Defined the missing function `event_hooks` with an empty implementation to satisfy the linker. You can replace this empty implementation with your custom event handling logic.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
