Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <pcap/pcap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t device_len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  size_t ebuf_len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto device = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(device_len);
  auto ebuf = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(ebuf_len);
  pcapint_create_interface(device.data(), ebuf.data());
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'pcapint_create_interface'
```
This error is caused by the fact that the function `pcapint_create_interface` is declared in the header file `pcap/pcap.h`, but the definition of the function is not included in the program. To fix this error, the header file `pcap/pcap.h` needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the function `pcapint_create_interface` is declared with the `C` calling convention, and the program is compiled with the `C++` calling convention. The `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to use the `C` calling convention for the function `pcapint_create_interface`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
