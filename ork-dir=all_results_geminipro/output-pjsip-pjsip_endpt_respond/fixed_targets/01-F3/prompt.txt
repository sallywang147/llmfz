Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pjsip.h>
#include <pjlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <pjmedia.h>
#include <pjsip_ua.h>
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  pjsip_endpoint *endpt = pjsip_endpt_create(NULL, NULL);
  pjsip_module *tsx_user = NULL;
  pjsip_rx_data *rdata = NULL;
  int st_code = 200;
  pj_str_t *st_text = NULL;
  pjsip_hdr *hdr_list = NULL;
  pjsip_msg_body *body = NULL;
  pjsip_transaction **p_tsx = NULL;

  pjsip_endpt_respond(endpt, tsx_user, rdata, st_code, st_text, hdr_list, body,
                      p_tsx);

  pjsip_endpt_destroy(endpt);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include` directives for `pjmedia.h` and `pjsip_ua.h`. This is necessary because these header files are written in C and not C++.
2. Included the necessary header files (`pjmedia.h` and `pjsip_ua.h`) for the functions and types used in the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
