Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pistache/http.h>
#include <sstream>

using namespace Pistache;

extern "C" {
#include <sstream>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  // Cookie parsing
  Pistache::Http::Cookie cookie1;
  try {
    cookie1.parse(input);
  } catch (...) {
  }

  Pistache::Http::Cookie cookie2;
  try {
    cookie2.parse(input);
  } catch (...) {
  }

  // Cookie writing
  std::stringstream ss;
  cookie1.write(&cookie1, &ss);
  cookie2.write(&cookie2, &ss);

  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `std::stringstream` library was missing. To fix the issue, the `#include <sstream>` directive was added.

The `extern "C" {}` block was added around the `#include <sstream>` directive to ensure that the C++ standard library functions are not mangled by the C++ compiler, which is necessary for the LLVMFuzzer to work correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
