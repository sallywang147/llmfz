Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <butteraugli/butteraugli_comparator.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> buffer;
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    buffer.push_back(stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>());
  }
  butteraugli::ButteraugliComparator comparator;
  std::vector<float> mask_x, mask_y;
  comparator.Mask(&buffer, &mask_x, &mask_y);
  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the `Mask` function of the `butteraugli::ButteraugliComparator` class is called with three arguments: `&comparator`, `&mask_x`, and `&mask_y`. However, the correct usage of this function is to pass the image data as the first argument. To fix this, the first argument of the `Mask` function is changed to `&buffer`, which is a vector containing the image data.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
