Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "config.h"
#include "auth.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct auth_zones *az = NULL;
  struct module_env *env = NULL;
  char *nm = NULL;
  size_t nmlen = 0;
  short dclass = 0;

  if (size > 0) {
    nm = (char *)malloc(size);
    memcpy(nm, data, size);
    nmlen = size;
  }

  auth_zones_startprobesequence(az, env, nm, nmlen, dclass);

  if (nm) {
    free(nm);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing declaration of the `auth_zones_startprobesequence` function. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that declares this function. In this case, the header file is `auth.h`.

To fix the code, we need to add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include "auth.h"
```

This will include the `auth.h` header file and make the declaration of the `auth_zones_startprobesequence` function available to the compiler.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
