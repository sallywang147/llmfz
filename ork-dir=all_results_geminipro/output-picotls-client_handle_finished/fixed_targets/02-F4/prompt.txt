Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <assert.h>
#include <getopt.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <openssl/engine.h>
#include <openssl/err.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ptls/ptls.h>
}

int client_handle_finished(struct st_ptls_t * tls, struct st_ptls_message_emitter_t * emitter, char * message, size_t message_size) {
  int ret;
  ret = ptls_handshake_client_finished(tls, emitter, message, message_size);
  return ret;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int ret;
  struct st_ptls_t *tls;
  struct st_ptls_message_emitter_t *emitter;
  char message[4096];

  tls = ptls_new(PTLS_CLIENT_MODE, PTLS_MTU_1350);
  assert(tls != NULL);

  emitter = ptls_get_message_emitter(tls);
  assert(emitter != NULL);

  ret = client_handle_finished(tls, emitter, message, size);
  assert(ret == 0);

  ptls_free(tls);

  return 0;
}

int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

The missing function is `main`. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it is required for the program to run.

The error message "undefined reference to `ptls_new`" means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ptls_new`. This is because the header file `ptls/ptls.h` does not contain the definition of the function. The definition of the function is in the library `libevent`. To fix the error, you need to link the program with the library `libevent`.

The error message "undefined reference to `ptls_get_message_emitter`" means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ptls_get_message_emitter`. This is because the header file `ptls/ptls.h` does not contain the definition of the function. The definition of the function is in the library `libevent`. To fix the error, you need to link the program with the library `libevent`.

The error message "undefined reference to `ptls_handshake_client_finished`" means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ptls_handshake_client_finished`. This is because the header file `ptls/ptls.h` does not contain the definition of the function. The definition of the function is in the library `libevent`. To fix the error, you need to link the program with the library `libevent`.

The error message "undefined reference to `ptls_free`" means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ptls_free`. This is because the header file `ptls/ptls.h` does not contain the definition of the function. The definition of the function is in the library `libevent`. To fix the error, you need to link the program with the library `libevent`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
