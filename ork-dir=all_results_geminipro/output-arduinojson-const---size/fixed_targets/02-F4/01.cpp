#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Pack.h"
}

int Pack(unsigned char* data, size_t size, const std::vector<unsigned char>& value) {
  int error = Pack(data, size, value.data(), value.size());
  if (!error) {
    size_t len = value.size();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `Pack` function is declared with three arguments, but it is called with four arguments in the `Pack` function definition. This will cause a compilation error.
2. The `value.size()` is not passed to the `Pack` function, which will cause the `Pack` function to fail.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Change the `Pack` function declaration to match the definition.
2. Pass the `value.size()` to the `Pack` function.

The corrected code is shown above.
