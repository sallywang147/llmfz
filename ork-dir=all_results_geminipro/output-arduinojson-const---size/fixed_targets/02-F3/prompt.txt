Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the `Pack` function is declared twice, once in the C++ code and once in the `Pack.h` header file. This causes a linker error because the linker doesn't know which definition of the function to use.

To fix this, remove the declaration of the `Pack` function from the C++ code. The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Pack.h"
}

int Pack(unsigned char* data, size_t size, const std::vector<unsigned char>& value) {
  int error = Pack(data, size, value.data());
  if (!error) {
    size_t len = value.size();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the linker will only see one definition of the `Pack` function, which is in the `Pack.h` header file. This will resolve the linker error and allow the program to build successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
