Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Pack.h"
}

int Pack(unsigned char* data, size_t size, const std::vector<unsigned char>& value) {
  int error = Pack(data, size, value.data(), value.size());
  if (!error) {
    size_t len = value.size();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `Pack` function is declared with three arguments, but it is called with four arguments in the `Pack` function definition. This will cause a compilation error.
2. The `value.size()` is not passed to the `Pack` function, which will cause the `Pack` function to fail.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Change the `Pack` function declaration to match the definition.
2. Pass the `value.size()` to the `Pack` function.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
