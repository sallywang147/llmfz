The issue is that the `Pack` function is declared twice, once in the C++ code and once in the `Pack.h` header file. This causes a linker error because the linker doesn't know which definition of the function to use.

To fix this, remove the declaration of the `Pack` function from the C++ code. The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Pack.h"
}

int Pack(unsigned char* data, size_t size, const std::vector<unsigned char>& value) {
  int error = Pack(data, size, value.data());
  if (!error) {
    size_t len = value.size();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the linker will only see one definition of the `Pack` function, which is in the `Pack.h` header file. This will resolve the linker error and allow the program to build successfully.
