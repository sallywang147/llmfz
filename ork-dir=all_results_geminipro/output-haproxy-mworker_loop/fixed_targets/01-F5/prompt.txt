Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "mworker.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    // Initialize global state here.
    initialized = true;
  }

  // Use the data provided by libFuzzer.
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Read some integers from the data.
  std::vector<int> integers;
  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    integers.push_back(provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>());
  }

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  mworker_loop(integers.data(), integers.size());

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. Added the `mworker.h` header file to the `#include` directives.
2. Wrapped the `#include` directive for `mworker.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
3. Added the `integers.data()` and `integers.size()` arguments to the `mworker_loop()` function call.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
