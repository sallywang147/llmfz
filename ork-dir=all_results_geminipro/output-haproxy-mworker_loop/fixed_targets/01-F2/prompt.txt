Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "mworker.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    // Initialize global state here.
    initialized = true;
  }

  // Use the data provided by libFuzzer.
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Read some integers from the data.
  std::vector<int> integers;
  while (provider.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    integers.push_back(provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>());
  }

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  mworker_loop();

  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the declaration for the function `mworker_loop()`. To fix this, we need to include the header file that declares this function. In this case, the header file is `mworker.h`.

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive for `mworker.h` with `extern "C" {}` because this header file contains C code, and we are compiling a C++ program. This is necessary because C and C++ have different calling conventions, and we need to tell the compiler that the function `mworker_loop()` is a C function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
