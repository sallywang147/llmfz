Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "ucl.h"

extern "C" {
#include <lib/ucl/ucl.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    ucl_init();
    initialized = true;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> buffer(provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes());

  ucl_parser* parser = ucl_parser_new(0);
  if (parser == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  bool default_try = provider.ConsumeBool();
  bool default_sign = provider.ConsumeBool();

  ucl_object_s* args = ucl_object_new(parser);
  if (args == nullptr) {
    ucl_parser_free(parser);
    return 0;
  }

  bool success = ucl_include_common(reinterpret_cast<char*>(buffer.data()),
                                    buffer.size(), args, parser, default_try,
                                    default_sign);
  if (!success) {
    ucl_object_free(args);
    ucl_parser_free(parser);
    return 0;
  }

  ucl_object_free(args);
  ucl_parser_free(parser);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

- The `ucl.h` header file was included twice, once with `#include "ucl.h"` and once with `#include <lib/ucl/ucl.h>`. This caused a compiler error because the header file was defined twice.
- The `ucl_init()` function was called twice, once in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` function and once in the `main()` function. This caused a runtime error because the `ucl_init()` function can only be called once.

To fix these issues, the `ucl.h` header file was included only once, with `#include "ucl.h"`, and the `ucl_init()` function was called only once, in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
