Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/daemon/lldpd.h"
#include "../src/daemon/log.h"

extern "C" {
#include "../src/daemon/netlink.h"
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  struct lldpd cfg;
  cfg.g_config.c_mgmt_pattern = NULL;
  cfg.g_config.c_tx_hold = LLDPD_TX_HOLD;

  // Use `log_register_donothing` instead of `donothing`.
  log_register_donothing();
  netlink_initialize(&cfg);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The function `donothing` was not defined.
2. The function `log_register_donothing` was not defined.

The fixed code uses the function `log_register_donothing` instead of `donothing`. The function `log_register_donothing` is defined in the header file `log.h`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
