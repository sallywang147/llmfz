Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(nullptr);
  if (!ctx) {
    return 0;
  }
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string uri_path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string uri_query = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  coap_persist_startup(ctx, uri_path.c_str(), uri_query.c_str(),
                        filename.c_str(), flags);
  coap_free_context(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixes are as follows:

1. The `const_cast` is removed from the call to `coap_persist_startup`. This is because the `uri_path`, `uri_query`, and `filename` strings are already constant, so there is no need to cast them to `const char*`.
2. The `const` is removed from the declaration of the `ctx` variable. This is because the `coap_new_context` function returns a non-const pointer to the context, so the `ctx` variable must be declared as non-const as well.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
