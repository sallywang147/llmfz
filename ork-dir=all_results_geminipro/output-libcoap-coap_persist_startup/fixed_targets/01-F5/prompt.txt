Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_context *ctx = coap_new_context(nullptr);
  if (!ctx) {
    return 0;
  }
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string uri_path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string uri_query = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  coap_persist_startup(ctx, uri_path.c_str(), uri_query.c_str(),
                        filename.c_str(), flags);
  coap_free_context(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects C-style linkage for the functions and variables declared in this header.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to use C-style linkage for the symbols declared in this header.

2. The function `coap_persist_startup` is not declared in the header `<coap3/coap.h>`. This causes a compiler error because the compiler cannot find the definition of this function.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the header `<coap3/coap.h>` includes the declaration of the function `coap_persist_startup`. We can do this by including the header `<coap3/coap_internal.h>`, which contains the declaration of this function.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
