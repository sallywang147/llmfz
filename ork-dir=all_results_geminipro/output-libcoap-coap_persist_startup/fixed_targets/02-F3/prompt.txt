Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(NULL);
  if (!ctx) {
    return 0;
  }
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t path_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const size_t db_path_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const size_t log_path_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const int enable = provider.ConsumeBool();
  char *path = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(path_size).data();
  char *db_path = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(db_path_size).data();
  char *log_path = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(log_path_size).data();

  coap_set_log_level(LOG_DEBUG);
  coap_persist_startup(ctx, path, db_path, log_path, enable);

  coap_free_context(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive to resolve the "undefined reference to" errors.

- Added `coap_set_log_level(LOG_DEBUG);` before `coap_persist_startup()` to enable debug logging. This is necessary because the default log level is LOG_WARNING, which means that no log messages will be printed unless they are at the WARNING level or higher.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
