Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is most likely caused by the missing definition of the function `is_legal_2d_block_size`. To fix the issue, we need to define the function.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  int xdim = fdp.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int ydim = fdp.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  bool result = is_legal_2d_block_size(xdim, ydim);
  return 0;
}

bool is_legal_2d_block_size(int xdim, int ydim) {
  // Check if the dimensions are positive.
  if (xdim <= 0 || ydim <= 0) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check if the dimensions are within the allowed range.
  if (xdim > 1024 || ydim > 1024) {
    return false;
  }

  // The dimensions are legal.
  return true;
}
```

The `is_legal_2d_block_size` function checks if the given dimensions are valid for a 2D block. The function returns `true` if the dimensions are positive and within the allowed range, and `false` otherwise.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
