Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"
#include "is_legal_2d_block_size.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libfuzzer/libfuzzer_exports.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Generate valid input values
  int xdim = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 16);
  int ydim = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 16);

  // Call the function under test
  bool result = is_legal_2d_block_size(xdim, ydim);

  // Use the result
  (void)result;

  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'
```

This error occurs because the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared in the header file `libfuzzer/libfuzzer_exports.h`, which is not included in the code. To fix this error, we need to include this header file in the code.

To do this, we add the following line to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "libfuzzer/libfuzzer_exports.h"
```

We also need to wrap the inclusion of this header file with `extern "C" {}`, because it is a C header file and we are using it in a C++ program.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
