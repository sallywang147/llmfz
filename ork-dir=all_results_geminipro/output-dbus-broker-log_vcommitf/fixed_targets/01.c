```

The original code has the following issues:

* The `log.h` header file is not included.
* The `log_vcommitf` function is not declared as `extern "C"`.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

* The `log.h` header file has been included.
* The `log_vcommitf` function has been declared as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.
