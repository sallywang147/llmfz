Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code has the following issues:

1. The `log_vcommitf` function is not defined.

To fix this issue, add the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "log.h"
```

2. The `va_start` and `va_end` functions are not defined.

To fix this issue, add the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <stdarg.h>
```

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

#include "log.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Log log;
  char *format = (char *)data;
  struct __va_list_tag args;

  va_start(args, format);
  log_vcommitf(&log, format, &args);
  va_end(args);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
