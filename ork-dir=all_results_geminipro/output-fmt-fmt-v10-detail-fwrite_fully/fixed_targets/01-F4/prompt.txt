Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fmt/core.h>

#include "fuzzer-common.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  const auto count = assign_from_buf<size_t>(data);
  data += sizeof(size_t);
  size -= sizeof(size_t);

  const auto stream = assign_from_buf<FILE *>(data);
  data += sizeof(FILE *);
  size -= sizeof(FILE *);

  if (count > size)
    return 0;

  fmt::detail::fwrite_fully(as_chars(data), count, stream);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <stdio.h>` line. This is necessary because the `stdio.h` header is a C header, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is a C++ function. Without this, the linker would not be able to find the definition of the `stdio.h` functions.
- Added `#include <cstdio>` at the beginning of the code. This is necessary because the `stdio.h` header is a C header, and the `fmt` library is a C++ library. Without this, the `fmt` library would not be able to find the definition of the `stdio.h` functions.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
