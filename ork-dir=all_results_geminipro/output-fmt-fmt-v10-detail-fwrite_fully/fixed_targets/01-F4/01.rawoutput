```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fmt/core.h>

#include "fuzzer-common.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  const auto count = assign_from_buf<size_t>(data);
  data += sizeof(size_t);
  size -= sizeof(size_t);

  const auto stream = assign_from_buf<FILE *>(data);
  data += sizeof(FILE *);
  size -= sizeof(FILE *);

  if (count > size)
    return 0;

  fmt::detail::fwrite_fully(as_chars(data), count, stream);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <stdio.h>` line. This is necessary because the `stdio.h` header is a C header, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is a C++ function. Without this, the linker would not be able to find the definition of the `stdio.h` functions.
- Added `#include <cstdio>` at the beginning of the code. This is necessary because the `stdio.h` header is a C header, and the `fmt` library is a C++ library. Without this, the `fmt` library would not be able to find the definition of the `stdio.h` functions.
