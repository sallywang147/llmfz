Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

#include "Firestore/core/src/model/patch_mutation.h"

using firebase::firestore::model::PatchMutation;

extern "C" {
#ifndef __APPLE__
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
#else
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, size_t size) {
#endif
  const char *str_ptr = reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data);
  std::string str{str_ptr, size};

  PatchMutation::Rep rep;
  rep.ToString(&str);
  return 0;
}
}  // extern "C"
```

The build error is caused by the different type definition of `uint8_t` in different platforms. The code above fixes this issue by using `unsigned char` instead of `uint8_t` in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function signature.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
