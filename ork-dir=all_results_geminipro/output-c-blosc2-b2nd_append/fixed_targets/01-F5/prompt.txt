Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "b2nd.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    b2nd_init();
    initialized = true;
  }
  int ret;
  struct b2nd_array_t* array = b2nd_array_new(&ret);
  if (array == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  size_t array_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1<<20);
  std::vector<char> array_data(array_size);
  provider.ConsumeBytes(array_data.data(), array_size);

  char delim = provider.ConsumeIntegral<char>();

  b2nd_append(array, array_data.data(), array_size, delim);

  b2nd_array_delete(array);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` is not included.
2. The function `b2nd_init()` is not defined.
3. The function `b2nd_array_new()` is not defined.
4. The function `b2nd_append()` is not defined.
5. The function `b2nd_array_delete()` is not defined.

To fix these issues, the following changes are made:

1. The header file `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` is included.
2. The function `b2nd_init()` is defined in the header file `b2nd.h`.
3. The function `b2nd_array_new()` is defined in the header file `b2nd.h`.
4. The function `b2nd_append()` is defined in the header file `b2nd.h`.
5. The function `b2nd_array_delete()` is defined in the header file `b2nd.h`.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
