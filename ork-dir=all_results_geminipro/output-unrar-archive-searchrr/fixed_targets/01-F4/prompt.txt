Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "archive.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h"
}

DEFINE_FUZZER(LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) {
  FuzzedDataProvider data_provider(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = data_provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(size);
  Archive archive;
  archive.Read(bytes.data(), bytes.size());
  archive.SearchRR();
}
```
In this fixed code, the `ConsumeBytes` method is called with a template argument specifying the type of elements to consume, which is `uint8_t` in this case. This ensures that the method returns a vector of `uint8_t` elements, which can then be used to initialize the `bytes` vector.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
