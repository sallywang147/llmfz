Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "lz4hc.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t src_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1 << 20);
  const size_t max_dst_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1 << 20);
  const int c_level = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 16);
  std::vector<char> src_buffer(src_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(src_buffer.data(), src_buffer.size());
  std::vector<char> dst_buffer(max_dst_size);

  const int ret = LZ4_compressHC2_limitedOutput(
      src_buffer.data(), dst_buffer.data(), src_buffer.size(), max_dst_size,
      c_level);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `LZ4_compressHC2_limitedOutput` function is declared with the `extern "C"` keyword, but the `lz4hc.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the compiler cannot find the definition of the function.

2. The `std::vector` class is not declared in the global scope. This causes a compiler error because the compiler cannot find the definition of the class.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The `lz4hc.h` header file is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to look for the definition of the `LZ4_compressHC2_limitedOutput` function in the C language, rather than the C++ language.

2. The `std::vector` class is declared in the global scope. This makes the class visible to the compiler.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
