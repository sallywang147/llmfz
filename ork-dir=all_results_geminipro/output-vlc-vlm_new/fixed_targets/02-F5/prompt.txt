Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif

#include "src/vlm/vlm.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" void vlc_libvlc_int_init(struct libvlc_int_t *libvlc);

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv);
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size);

static struct libvlc_int_t libvlc;
static struct vlm_t *vlm;

extern "C" {
#include <libvlc/libvlc.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {
  (void)argc;
  (void)argv;

  vlc_libvlc_int_init(&libvlc);

  return 0;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  vlm = vlm_New(&libvlc, NULL);
  if (vlm == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  vlm_AddBuffer(vlm, data, size);
  vlm_Parse(vlm);

  vlm_Delete(vlm);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* Added the declaration of `vlc_libvlc_int_init` to the top of the file.
* Wrapped the `#include <libvlc/libvlc.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
