#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs/apfs.h"

extern "C" {
#include <apfs/apfs_fs.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat fs;
  char result;

  result = fs.istat(&fs, 0, nullptr, 0, 0, 0);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:
1. The header file `apfs/apfs_fs.h` is not included, which is required for the definition of the `APFSFSCompat` struct and the `istat` function.
2. The `istat` function is declared in the `apfs/apfs_fs.h` header file with the `C` linkage, so it needs to be declared with the `extern "C"` directive in order to be visible to the linker.

To fix the code, we need to include the `apfs/apfs_fs.h` header file and wrap the `#include` directive with the `extern "C"` directive.

The corrected code is shown above.
