Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs/apfs.h"

extern "C" {
#include <apfs/apfs_fs.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat fs;
  char result;

  result = fs.istat(&fs, 0, nullptr, 0, 0, 0);

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code is shown above.

The main difference from the original code is that the `#include <apfs/apfs_fs.h>` directive is now wrapped with the `extern "C"` directive. This is necessary because the `istat` function is declared in the `apfs/apfs_fs.h` header file with the `C` linkage, so it needs to be declared with the `extern "C"` directive in order to be visible to the linker.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
