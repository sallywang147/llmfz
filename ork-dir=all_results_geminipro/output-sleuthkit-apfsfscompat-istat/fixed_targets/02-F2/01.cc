#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs/apfs.h"

extern "C" {
#include <apfs/apfs_fs.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat fs;
  char result;

  result = fs.istat(&fs, 0, nullptr, 0, 0, 0);

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code is shown above.

The main difference from the original code is that the `#include <apfs/apfs_fs.h>` directive is now wrapped with the `extern "C"` directive. This is necessary because the `istat` function is declared in the `apfs/apfs_fs.h` header file with the `C` linkage, so it needs to be declared with the `extern "C"` directive in order to be visible to the linker.
