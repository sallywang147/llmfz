Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat *fs;
  FILE *hFile;
  size_t inode_num;
  size_t numblock;
  int sec_skew;
  char result;

  fs = new APFSFSCompat();
  hFile = stdin;
  inode_num = 0;
  numblock = 0;
  sec_skew = 0;

  result = fs->istat(hFile, inode_num, numblock, sec_skew);

  delete fs;

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `istat_flags` variable was removed from the call to `istat` because it was not defined.
- The `_IO_FILE *` type was changed to `FILE *` because `_IO_FILE` is an implementation detail of the C standard library and should not be used directly in user code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
