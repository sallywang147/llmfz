Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <glib.h>
#include <glib-object.h>

extern "C" {
#include "mdbtools.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  MdbHandle *mdb = mdb_open_buffer((void *)Data, Size, MDB_NOFLAGS);
  if (mdb) {
    mdb_read_catalog(mdb, MDB_TABLE);
    for (int j = 0; j < mdb->num_catalog; j++) {
      MdbCatalogEntry *entry = g_ptr_array_index(mdb->catalog, j);
      MdbTableDef *table = mdb_read_table(entry);
      if (table) {
        mdb_read_columns(table);
        mdb_data_dump(table);
        mdb_free_tabledef(table);
      }
    }
    mdb_close(mdb);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `glib.h` and `glib-object.h` headers were not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler was trying to mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in these headers, which is not compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.

2. The `mdbtools.h` header was not included with the `extern "C" {}` directive. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler was trying to mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in this header, which is not compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.

The fixed code wraps the `glib.h` and `glib-object.h` headers in `extern "C" {}` and includes the `mdbtools.h` header with the `extern "C" {}` directive. This ensures that the names of the functions and variables declared in these headers are not mangled by the C++ compiler, which is compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
