The original code had the following issues:

1. The `glib.h` and `glib-object.h` headers were not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler was trying to mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in these headers, which is not compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.

2. The `mdbtools.h` header was not included with the `extern "C" {}` directive. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler was trying to mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in this header, which is not compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.

The fixed code wraps the `glib.h` and `glib-object.h` headers in `extern "C" {}` and includes the `mdbtools.h` header with the `extern "C" {}` directive. This ensures that the names of the functions and variables declared in these headers are not mangled by the C++ compiler, which is compatible with the C linkage used by the `mdbtools.h` header.
