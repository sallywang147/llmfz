Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
}

int handle_conn_read(int socknum);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int socknum = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  handle_conn_read(socknum);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the original code:

1. Added the declaration for the `handle_conn_read` function.
2. Wrapped the `#include` directives for `<sys/socket.h>` and `<netinet/in.h>` with `extern "C" {}`.

These changes fix the build issues and allow the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
