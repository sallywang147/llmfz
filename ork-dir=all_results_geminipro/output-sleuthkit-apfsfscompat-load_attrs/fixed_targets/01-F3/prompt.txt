Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_compat.h"
#include "tsk/fs/tsk_fs_i.h"

extern "C" {
#include "tsk/fs/tsk_fs.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat *apfs_compat = new APFSFSCompat();
  if (apfs_compat == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  TSK_FS_INFO *fs_info = nullptr;
  TSK_FS_FILE *fs_file = nullptr;

  apfs_compat->load_attrs(apfs_compat, fs_info, fs_file);

  delete apfs_compat;

  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the `load_attrs` method of the `APFSFSCompat` class is called with two arguments, `apfs_compat` and `fs_file`. However, the `load_attrs` method actually takes three arguments: `apfs_compat`, `fs_info`, and `fs_file`. This is why the build is failing with an error message about a missing argument.

To fix the code, we need to pass the correct number of arguments to the `load_attrs` method. We can do this by adding the `fs_info` argument to the call to `load_attrs`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_compat.h"
#include "tsk/fs/tsk_fs_i.h"

extern "C" {
#include "tsk/fs/tsk_fs.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSFSCompat *apfs_compat = new APFSFSCompat();
  if (apfs_compat == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  TSK_FS_INFO *fs_info = nullptr;
  TSK_FS_FILE *fs_file = nullptr;

  apfs_compat->load_attrs(apfs_compat, fs_info, fs_file);

  delete apfs_compat;

  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should build and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
