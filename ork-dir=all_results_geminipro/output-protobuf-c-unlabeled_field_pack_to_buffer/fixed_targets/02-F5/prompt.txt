Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzing/memory.hpp>
#include <protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzing/memory.hpp>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ProtobufCBuffer buffer;
  protobuf_c_buffer_init(&buffer, 0, NULL);

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t field_count = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10);
  ProtobufCFieldDescriptor *fields[field_count];
  char *members[field_count];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < field_count; ++i) {
    fields[i] = (ProtobufCFieldDescriptor *)stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint64_t>();
    members[i] = (char *)stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint64_t>();
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < field_count; ++i) {
    size_t len = protobuf_c_message_pack_to_buffer(fields[i]->message, fields[i], members[i], &buffer);
    uint8_t *copy = (uint8_t *)malloc(len);
    protobuf_c_buffer_copy(copy, &buffer);
    fuzzing::memory::memory_test(copy, len);
    free(copy);
  }

  protobuf_c_buffer_fini(&buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The function `unlabeled_field_pack_to_buffer` is not defined. It should be `protobuf_c_message_pack_to_buffer`.
2. The `ProtobufCFieldDescriptor` struct is not defined. It should be included from the `protobuf-c` header.
3. The `ProtobufCMessage` struct is not defined. It should be included from the `protobuf-c` header.

The fixed code includes the necessary headers and uses the correct function and struct names.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
