Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "client.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t flags = provider.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::string path = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  client_connect(nullptr, path.c_str(), flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message indicates that the function `client_connect` is not defined. To fix this, the header file `client.h` needs to be included in the code. The header file should contain the declaration of the `client_connect` function.

To include the header file, the following line is added to the top of the code:

```c++
#include "client.h"
```

The header file `client.h` should be placed in the same directory as the source file or in a directory that is included in the compiler's search path.

In addition, the `client_connect` function is declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for the C++ compiler to recognize it as a C function. This is because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as `extern "C"`, which means that it is a C function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
