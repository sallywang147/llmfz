Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "client.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t path_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> path_bytes = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(path_size);
  char* path = reinterpret_cast<char*>(path_bytes.data());
  const size_t flags = provider.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  client_connect(nullptr, path, flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `client.h` is not included.
2. The function `client_connect` is not declared.

To fix the issues, we need to:

1. Include the header file `client.h`.
2. Wrap the `#include` directive of `client.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
3. Declare the function `client_connect`.

After applying these fixes, the code should compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
