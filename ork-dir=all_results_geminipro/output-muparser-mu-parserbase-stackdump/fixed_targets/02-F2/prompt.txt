Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

#include "muParser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"
}

using namespace llvm;

static cl::opt<std::string> InputFile(cl::Positional, cl::desc("<input file>"),
                                      cl::init("-"), cl::value_desc("filename"));

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string line_string((char *)data, size);
  try {
    mu::Parser parser;
    parser.SetExpr(line_string);
    parser.Eval();
    std::stack<mu::Parser::token> op_stack;
    std::stack<mu::Parser::token> val_stack;
    parser.StackDump(&op_stack, &val_stack);
  } catch (mu::Parser::exception_type &e) {
  } catch (mu::ParserError &e) {
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is not declared as `extern "C"`.
2. The `llvm::cl::opt` class is not included.

To fix the first issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for the LLVM header with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the LLVM header uses C++11 features, which are not compatible with C.

To fix the second issue, we need to include the `llvm/Support/CommandLine.h` header. This header contains the definition of the `llvm::cl::opt` class.

After fixing these issues, the code should compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
