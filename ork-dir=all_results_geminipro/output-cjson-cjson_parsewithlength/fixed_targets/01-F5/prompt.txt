Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "../cJSON.h"

LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  cJSON *json;
  unsigned char *copied;

  if (size <= 1)
    return 0;
  if (data[size - 1] != '\0')
    return 0;

  copied = (unsigned char *)malloc(size);
  if (copied == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(copied, data, size);

  json = cJSON_ParseWithLength((char *)copied, size - 1);

  if (json == NULL)
    return 0;

  cJSON_Delete(json);

  free(copied);

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `cJSON.h` header file was not properly included. It should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names.

2. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was not properly declared. It should be declared as `extern "C"` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function name.

The fixed code includes the `cJSON.h` header file properly and declares the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function as `extern "C"`. This ensures that the code compiles and links correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
