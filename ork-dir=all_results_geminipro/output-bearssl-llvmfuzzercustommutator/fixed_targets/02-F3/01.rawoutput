```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <utility>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char* data, size_t size, size_t max_size,
                                         int seed) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Mutate the size of the input.
  size_t new_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, max_size);
  if (new_size != size) {
    data = static_cast<char*>(realloc(data, new_size));
    if (data == nullptr) {
      return 0;
    }
    memset(data + size, 0, new_size - size);
    size = new_size;
  }

  // Mutate the contents of the input.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    data[i] = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  }

  return size;
}
```

The original code has several issues that cause the build error.

1. The `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive is missing. This directive is necessary to include the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, which is used to generate random input data for the fuzzer.

2. The `extern "C" {}` block is missing around the `#include <stdlib.h>` and `#include <string.h>` directives. This block is necessary to ensure that the C standard library functions are properly linked to the fuzzer.

3. The `LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator` function is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary to ensure that it is properly linked to the fuzzer.

The corrected code includes all of the necessary directives and declarations, and it should now build successfully.
