Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "combinator.hpp"

using iter::Combinator;

extern "C" {

void FuzzCombinator(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  std::string s = fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  auto c = Combinator<std::string &>(s);
  auto it = c.begin();
  it.zero_length_end(&it, &s);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzCombinator(data, size);
  return 0;
}

} // extern "C"
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
