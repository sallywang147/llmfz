Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <assert.h>
#include <getopt.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int ptls_client_handle_message(struct st_ptls_t * tls, struct st_ptls_buffer_t * sendbuf, size_t * epoch_offsets, size_t in_epoch, char * input, size_t inlen, struct st_ptls_handshake_properties_t * properties)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int ptls_client_handle_message(struct st_ptls_t * tls, struct st_ptls_buffer_t * sendbuf, size_t * epoch_offsets, size_t in_epoch, char * input, size_t inlen, struct st_ptls_handshake_properties_t * properties)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
