Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "MQTTClient.h"

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string client_id = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const std::string topic = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const std::string message = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const int qos = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const bool retain = stream.ConsumeBool();

  MQTTClient client;
  MQTTMessage publish;
  func_type pubCb;
  MQTTClient_Publish_ex(&client, &publish, &pubCb);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `struct _MqttClient client;` and `struct _MqttMessage publish;` lines were changed to `MQTTClient client;` and `MQTTMessage publish;` respectively. This is because the `_` prefix is not necessary when using the `MQTTClient` library.
- The `func_type pubCb;` line was removed. This is because the `pubCb` parameter is not used in the `MQTTClient_Publish_ex` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int MqttClient_Publish_ex(struct _MqttClient * client, struct _MqttMessage * publish, func_type * pubCb)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int MqttClient_Publish_ex(struct _MqttClient * client, struct _MqttMessage * publish, func_type * pubCb)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
