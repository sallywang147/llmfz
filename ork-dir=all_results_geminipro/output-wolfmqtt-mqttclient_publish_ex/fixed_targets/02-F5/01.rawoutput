}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string client_id = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const std::string topic = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const std::string message = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);
  const int qos = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const bool retain = stream.ConsumeBool();

  MQTTClient client;
  MQTTMessage publish;
  MQTTClient_Publish_ex(&client, &publish, qos, retain);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `func_type pubCb;` line was removed. This is because the `pubCb` parameter is not used in the `MQTTClient_Publish_ex` function.
- The `MQTTClient_Publish_ex(&client, &publish, &pubCb);` line was changed to `MQTTClient_Publish_ex(&client, &publish, qos, retain);`. This is because the `qos` and `retain` parameters are required by the `MQTTClient_Publish_ex` function.
