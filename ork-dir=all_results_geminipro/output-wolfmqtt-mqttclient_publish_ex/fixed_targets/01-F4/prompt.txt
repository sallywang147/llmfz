Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "MQTTClient.h"

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string topic = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string payload = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  MQTTClient client;
  MQTTMessage publish;
  publish.qos = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 2);
  publish.retained = stream.ConsumeBool();
  publish.payload = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(const_cast<char*>(payload.c_str()));
  publish.payloadlen = payload.size();
  MQTTClient_deliveryToken token;

  MQTTClient_PublishMessage(&client, topic.c_str(), &publish, &token);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int MqttClient_Publish_ex(struct _MqttClient * client, struct _MqttMessage * publish, func_type * pubCb)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int MqttClient_Publish_ex(struct _MqttClient * client, struct _MqttMessage * publish, func_type * pubCb)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
