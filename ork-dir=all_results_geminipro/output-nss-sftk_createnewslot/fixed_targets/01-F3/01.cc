The build error was caused by the fact that the header `sftk.h` was included twice, once with `#include "sftk.h"` and once with `#include <sftk.h>`. This caused a conflict between the two versions of the header, and the compiler was unable to resolve it.

To fix the error, the `#include <sftk.h>` line was removed, and the `#include "sftk.h"` line was wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the header is only included once, and that the compiler is able to resolve the conflict.
