Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(NULL);
  if (!ctx) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int ret = coap_persist_startup_locked(ctx, NULL, NULL, path.c_str(), 0);
  if (ret == 0) {
    coap_delete_context(ctx);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `FuzzedDataProvider` class is defined in the `fuzzer` namespace, but the code was missing the `extern "C" {}` block to expose the `FuzzedDataProvider` class to C code.

2. The `coap3/coap.h` header file is a C header file, and it needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to be used in C++ code.

The fixed code includes the `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` header file within an `extern "C" {}` block, and it also wraps the `coap3/coap.h` header file with `extern "C" {}`. This allows the C++ code to access the `FuzzedDataProvider` class and the C functions from the `coap3/coap.h` header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
