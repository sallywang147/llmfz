```c++
#include <coap3/coap.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <coap3/coap.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(NULL);
  if (!ctx) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int ret = coap_persist_startup_locked(ctx, NULL, NULL, path.c_str(), 0);
  if (ret == 0) {
    coap_delete_context(ctx);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'coap_new_context'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `coap_new_context`. This is because the function is declared in the header file `coap3/coap.h`, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are linked into the program.

To fix this error, you need to add the source file that defines the function `coap_new_context` to the list of files that are linked into the program. This can be done by adding the following line to the Makefile:

```
SOURCES += coap3/coap.c
```

Once you have added this line to the Makefile, you should be able to build the program without errors.
