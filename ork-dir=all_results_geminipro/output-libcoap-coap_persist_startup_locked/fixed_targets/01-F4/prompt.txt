Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <coap3/coap_internal.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(nullptr);
  if (ctx == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  std::string db_path = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  std::string db_name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  std::string db_user = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  int db_pass_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 256);
  std::string db_pass = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(db_pass_len);
  coap_persist_startup_locked(ctx, db_path.c_str(), db_name.c_str(), db_user.c_str(),
                               db_pass_len);
  coap_free_context(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixes are:

1. Included the header file `coap_internal.h` inside an `extern "C" {}` block.
2. Included the header file `coap_internal.h` inside an `extern "C" {}` block again.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
