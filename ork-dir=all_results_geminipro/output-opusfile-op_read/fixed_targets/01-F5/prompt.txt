Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "opusfile/config.h"
#include "opusfile/include/opusfile.h"

extern "C" {
#include "opusfile/include/opus.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  OggOpusFile* of = op_open_file(file_name.c_str(), NULL);
  if (of == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  const int buf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  short* pcm = new short[buf_size];
  int li = 0;
  while (op_read(of, pcm, buf_size, &li) > 0) {
    // Do something with the decoded audio data
  }
  delete[] pcm;
  op_free(of);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

* The header `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` is not a standard C++ library and is not available on all compilers. To fix this, you can replace it with a more standard library such as `libfuzzer` or `libFuzzer`.

* The function `op_open_file()` is not defined in the C++ standard library. To fix this, you can include the header file `opusfile.h` from the Opus library, which defines this function.

* The function `op_read()` is not defined in the C++ standard library. To fix this, you can include the header file `opus.h` from the Opus library, which defines this function.

* The function `op_free()` is not defined in the C++ standard library. To fix this, you can include the header file `opusfile.h` from the Opus library, which defines this function.

The fixed code includes the necessary header files and uses the correct function names from the Opus library. It should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
