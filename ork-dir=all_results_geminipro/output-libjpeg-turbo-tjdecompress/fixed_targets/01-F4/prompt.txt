Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <turbojpeg.h>

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  tjhandle handle = NULL;
  unsigned char *dstBuf = NULL;
  int width = 0, height = 0, jpegSubsamp, jpegColorspace, pixelSize;
  int flags = 0;
  int pitch = 0;
#if defined(__has_feature) && __has_feature(memory_sanitizer)
  char env[18] = "JSIMD_FORCENONE=1";

  /* The libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions produce false positives with
     MemorySanitizer. */
  putenv(env);
#endif

  if ((handle = tjInitDecompress()) == NULL)
    goto bailout;

  /* We ignore the return value of tjDecompressHeader3(), because some JPEG
     images may have unusual subsampling configurations that the TurboJPEG API
     cannot identify but can still decompress. */
  tjDecompressHeader3(handle, data, size, &width, &height, &jpegSubsamp, &jpegColorspace);

  /* Ignore 0-pixel images and images larger than 1 Megapixel.  Casting width
     to (uint64_t) prevents integer overflow if width * height > INT_MAX. */
  if (width < 1 || height < 1 || (uint64_t)width * height > 1048576)
    goto bailout;

  if (jpegSubsamp < 0 || jpegSubsamp >= TJ_NUMSAMP)
    jpegSubsamp = TJSAMP_444;

  switch (jpegColorspace) {
  case TJCS_GRAY:
    pixelSize = 1;
    break;
  case TJCS_YCbCr:
    pixelSize = 3;
    break;
  case TJCS_RGB:
    pixelSize = 3;
    break;
  case TJCS_CMYK:
    pixelSize = 4;
    break;
  case TJCS_YCCK:
    pixelSize = 4;
    break;
  }

  dstBuf = (unsigned char *)malloc(width * height * pixelSize);
  if (!dstBuf)
    goto bailout;

  if (tjDecompress(handle, data, size, dstBuf, width, 0, height, pixelSize, flags) == 0) {
    /* Touch all of the output pixels in order to catch uninitialized reads
       when using MemorySanitizer. */
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < width * height * pixelSize; i++)
      sum += dstBuf[i];

    /* Prevent the code above from being optimized out.  This test should
       never be true, but the compiler doesn't know that. */
    if (sum > 255 * width * height * pixelSize)
      goto bailout;
  }

bailout:
  free(dstBuf);
  if (handle)
    tjDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `tjDecompress` function is called with an incorrect value for the `pitch` parameter. The `pitch` parameter specifies the number of bytes per line in the destination buffer, and it should be set to the width of the image multiplied by the pixel size. In the original code, the `pitch` parameter is set to 0, which is incorrect.

To fix the issue, the `pitch` parameter should be set to the width of the image multiplied by the pixel size. This can be done by adding the following line before the call to `tjDecompress`:

```c++
pitch = width * pixelSize;
```

With this change, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
