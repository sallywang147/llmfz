Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "yaml.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct yaml_emitter_s emitter;
  yaml_emitter_initialize(&emitter);

  const std::string text = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  size_t size_written;
  char* output = new char[text.size()];
  yaml_emitter_set_output_string(&emitter, output, text.size(), &size_written);
  yaml_emitter_dump(&emitter, reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(text.c_str()),
                    text.size());
  yaml_emitter_delete(&emitter);
  delete[] output;
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `yaml_emitter_initialize'
error: undefined reference to `yaml_emitter_set_output_string'
error: undefined reference to `yaml_emitter_dump'
error: undefined reference to `yaml_emitter_delete'
```

This means that the C library `yaml.h` is not properly linked to the program. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include "yaml.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the functions and types defined in `yaml.h` are written in C, not C++.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
