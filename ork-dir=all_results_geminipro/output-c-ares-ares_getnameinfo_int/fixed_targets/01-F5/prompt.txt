Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>

extern "C" {
#include "ares.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, unsigned long size) {
  // Call ares_getnameinfo to fix the build error
  ares_getnameinfo(NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void ares_getnameinfo_int(struct ares_channeldata * , struct sockaddr * , int , int , func_type * , char * )` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void ares_getnameinfo_int(struct ares_channeldata * , struct sockaddr * , int , int , func_type * , char * )` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
