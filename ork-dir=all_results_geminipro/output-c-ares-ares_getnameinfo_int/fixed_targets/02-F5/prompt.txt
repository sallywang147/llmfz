Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#include "ares.h"

extern "C" {
#include "ares_nameser.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, unsigned size) {
  struct sockaddr_in addr;
  memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
  addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
  addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
  ares_getnameinfo_int(NULL, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr),
                       ARES_NI_NUMERICHOST, NULL, NULL);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the `ares_getnameinfo_int` function call. This function is required to perform the name resolution. To fix the code, we added the function call to the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The build error message also mentioned that the `ares_getnameinfo_int` function was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. This is because the function is declared in the `ares_nameser.h` header file, which is not included in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. To fix this, we wrapped the `#include "ares_nameser.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C code, which is necessary for the linking to succeed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
