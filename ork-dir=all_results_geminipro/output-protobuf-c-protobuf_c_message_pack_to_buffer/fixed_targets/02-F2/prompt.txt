Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has the following issues:

1. The `protobuf-c.h` header is not properly guarded by `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `protobuf_c_message_pack_to_buffer` function is not declared in the `protobuf-c.h` header.

To fix these issues, add `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <protobuf-c.h>` line and declare the `protobuf_c_message_pack_to_buffer` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "protobuf-c.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t message_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  uint8_t* message = static_cast<uint8_t*>(malloc(message_size));
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(message, message_size);

  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  uint8_t* buffer = static_cast<uint8_t*>(malloc(buffer_size));

  ProtobufCBuffer pb_buffer;
  protobuf_c_buffer_init(&pb_buffer, buffer, buffer_size);

  size_t packed_size = protobuf_c_message_pack_to_buffer(
      reinterpret_cast<ProtobufCMessage*>(message), &pb_buffer);
  free(message);
  free(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
