Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "pb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "pb_decode.h"
#include "pb_encode.h"
}

struct pb_msgdesc_s {
  uint32_t size;
  const char *name;
  const pb_field_t *fields;
};

bool pb_get_encoded_size(size_t *size, struct pb_msgdesc_s *fields, char *src_struct) {
  return pb_get_encoded_size(size, fields, src_struct);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  struct pb_msgdesc_s fields;
  char src_struct[1024];
  size_t encoded_size;
  if (!pb_get_encoded_size(&encoded_size, &fields, src_struct)) {
    return 0;
  }
  char *encoded_data = new char[encoded_size];
  pb_encode(&fields, src_struct, encoded_data);
  delete[] encoded_data;
  return 0;
}
```

The issues in the original code are:

1. The `pb_encode` function is not included in the `extern "C" {}` block. This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function when trying to link the object file.
2. The `pb_get_encoded_size` function is not declared as `extern "C"`. This means that the compiler will not generate a symbol for the function, and the linker will not be able to find it.

The fixed code includes the `pb_encode` function in the `extern "C" {}` block and declares the `pb_get_encoded_size` function as `extern "C"`. This ensures that the linker can find the definitions of both functions and that the object file can be linked successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
