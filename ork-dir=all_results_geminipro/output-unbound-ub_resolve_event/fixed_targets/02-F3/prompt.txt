Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "unbound.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libuv/uv.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct ub_ctx *ctx = NULL;
  char *name = NULL;
  int rrtype = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int rrclass = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  char *mydata = NULL;
  func_type *callback = NULL;
  int *async_id = NULL;

  ub_ctx_init(&ctx);

  size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  name = new char[name_len + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(name, name_len);
  name[name_len] = '\0';

  int ret = ub_resolve_event(ctx, name, rrtype, rrclass, mydata, callback,
                             async_id);

  delete[] name;
  ub_ctx_delete(ctx);
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `ub_ctx_init` function is called without passing the address of the `ctx` variable, which is incorrect.
2. The `ub_resolve_event` function is called with the `mydata`, `callback`, and `async_id` arguments set to `NULL`, which is not valid.

The fixed code addresses these issues by passing the address of the `ctx` variable to `ub_ctx_init` and setting the `mydata`, `callback`, and `async_id` arguments to `NULL` in the call to `ub_resolve_event`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
