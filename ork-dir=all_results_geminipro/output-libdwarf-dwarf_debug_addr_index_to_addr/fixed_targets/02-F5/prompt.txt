Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The corrected code is:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include "dwarf.h"

#include <libdwarf/dwarf.h>

extern "C" {

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  size_t die_offset = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  size_t index = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  size_t return_addr;
  Dwarf_Error_s* error;
  dwarf_debug_addr_index_to_addr(nullptr, die_offset, index, &return_addr, &error);
  return 0;
}
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

- The header file `libdwarf/dwarf.h` is not included in the code.
- The function `dwarf_debug_addr_index_to_addr` is not defined in the code.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

- The header file `libdwarf/dwarf.h` has been included in the code.
- The function `dwarf_debug_addr_index_to_addr` has been declared in the code.

The corrected code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
