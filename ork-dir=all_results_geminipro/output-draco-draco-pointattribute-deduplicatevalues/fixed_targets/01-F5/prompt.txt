Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "draco/src/draco/core/geometry_attribute.h"
#include "draco/src/draco/core/point_attribute.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  draco::PointAttribute attribute;
  draco::GeometryAttribute geometry_attribute;
  int value_to_remove = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  attribute.DeduplicateValues(&geometry_attribute, value_to_remove);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `#include` directives for the Draco headers are wrapped in `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with `extern "C"` to indicate that it is a C function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
