Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include <gdbm.h>

extern "C" {
#include <gdbm-ndbm.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int replace = stream.ConsumeBool();
  int meta_mask = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t line;
  struct gdbm_file_info* pdbf;
  int ret = gdbm_load(&pdbf, filename.c_str(), replace, meta_mask, &line);
  if (ret == 0) {
    gdbm_close(pdbf);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The build issue is caused by the missing header file `gdbm-ndbm.h`. This header file is required for the function `gdbm_load`. To fix the issue, we need to include this header file in the code.

The corrected code includes the header file `gdbm-ndbm.h` using the `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the header file is written in C, and we are compiling the code in C++. The `extern "C" {}` block tells the compiler to compile the code inside the block as C code.

With this change, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
