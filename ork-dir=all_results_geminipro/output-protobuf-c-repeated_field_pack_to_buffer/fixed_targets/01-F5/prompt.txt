Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <assert.h>
#include <fuzzing/memory.hpp>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "protobuf-c.h"

extern "C" {
#include "repeated_field.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ProtobufCBuffer buffer;
  protobuf_c_buffer_init(&buffer, 0, NULL);

  ProtobufCFieldDescriptor field;
  field.name = "field";
  field.label = PROTOBUF_C_LABEL_REPEATED;
  field.type = PROTOBUF_C_TYPE_INT32;
  field.offset = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    int count = rand() % 100;
    int *member = (int *)malloc(count * sizeof(int));
    for (int j = 0; j < count; j++) {
      member[j] = rand();
    }

    size_t len = repeated_field_pack_to_buffer(&field, count, member, &buffer);
    uint8_t *copy = (uint8_t *)malloc(len);
    protobuf_c_buffer_copy(copy, &buffer);

    fuzzing::memory::memory_test(copy, len);

    protobuf_c_buffer_free(&buffer);
    free(copy);
    free(member);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the header file `repeated_field.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include "repeated_field.h"
```

This will include the header file and allow the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
