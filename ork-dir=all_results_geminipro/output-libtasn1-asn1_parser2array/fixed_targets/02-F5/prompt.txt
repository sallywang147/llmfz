Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "asn1_parser2array.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input_file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string output_file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string vector_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string error_desc = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int ret = asn1_parser2array(
      input_file_name.c_str(),
      output_file_name.c_str(),
      vector_name.c_str(),
      error_desc.c_str());

  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` is not included in the `extern "C" {}` block. This means that the `FuzzedDataProvider` class is not visible to the C code in `asn1_parser2array.h`.
2. The function `asn1_parser2array` is not declared as `extern "C"`. This means that the C++ compiler will not generate a symbol for the function, and the linker will not be able to find it.

To fix the code, we need to:

1. Add the `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` header file to the `extern "C" {}` block.
2. Declare the `asn1_parser2array` function as `extern "C"`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
