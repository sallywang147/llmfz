Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "MQTTClient.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  int rc = MqttClient_Init(&client, 1000, 10000, 10000, 10000);
  if (rc != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }
  rc = MqttClient_Connect(&client, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes(), 1000);
  if (rc != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }
  rc = MqttClient_Ping(&client);
  MqttClient_Disconnect(&client, 1000);
  MqttClient_Destroy(&client);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. Added the necessary header `#include` directives for the MQTTClient library functions.
2. Updated the `MqttClient_Init` function to use the correct arguments according to the MQTTClient library documentation.
3. Added `MqttClient_Connect` and `MqttClient_Disconnect` functions to establish and terminate the MQTT connection.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
