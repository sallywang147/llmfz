The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string client_id = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  MQTTClient client = MQTTClient(client_id.c_str());

  int ret = MQTTClient_connect(&client, "localhost", 1883, 1000);
  if (ret != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }

  ret = MqttClient_Ping(&client);
  if (ret != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }

  MQTTClient_disconnect(&client, 10000);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the original code:

1. The header file `MQTTClient.h` is included only once, and it is wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to prevent it from being included twice.
2. The function `MqttClient_connect` and `MQTTClient_disconnect` are added to the source file.
3. The function `MqttClient_Ping` is called after the client is connected.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
