Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "MQTTClient.h"

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string client_id = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  MQTTClient client = MQTTClient(client_id.c_str());

  int ret = MqttClient_Ping(&client);
  if (ret != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `MQTTClient.h` is included twice, which is not allowed.
2. The function `MqttClient_Ping` is declared in the header file `MQTTClient.h`, but it is not defined in the source file.

To fix the first issue, we can wrap the second `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to prevent the header file from being included twice.

To fix the second issue, we can add the definition of the function `MqttClient_Ping` to the source file.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
