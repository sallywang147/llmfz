  int ret = MqttClient_Ping(&client);

  return 0;

```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `MQTTClient.h` is included twice, which is not allowed.
2. The function `MqttClient_Ping` is declared in the header file `MQTTClient.h`, but it is not defined in the source file.

To fix the first issue, we can wrap the second `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to prevent the header file from being included twice.

To fix the second issue, we can add the definition of the function `MqttClient_Ping` to the source file.

The corrected code is shown above.
