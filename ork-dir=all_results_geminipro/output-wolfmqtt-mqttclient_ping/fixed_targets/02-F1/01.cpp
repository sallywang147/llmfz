The build issue is caused by the missing `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include "MQTTClient.h"` directive. This is necessary because the MQTTClient library is written in C and uses the C calling convention, while the fuzzer code is written in C++ and uses the C++ calling convention. By wrapping the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`, we tell the compiler to use the C calling convention for the functions and variables declared in the MQTTClient header file. This allows the fuzzer code to call the MQTTClient functions correctly.
