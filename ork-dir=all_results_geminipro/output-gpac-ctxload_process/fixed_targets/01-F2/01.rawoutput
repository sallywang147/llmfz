The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ctxload_process` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `ctxload_process` function. In this case, we need to include the `gpac/ctxload.h` header file.

2. The `gf_fs_load_source` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `gf_fs_load_source` function. In this case, we need to include the `gpac/source.h` header file.

3. The `gf_fs_load_filter` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `gf_fs_load_filter` function. In this case, we need to include the `gpac/filter.h` header file.

4. The `gf_fs_run` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `gf_fs_run` function. In this case, we need to include the `gpac/filter.h` header file.

5. The `gf_fs_del` function is not declared.

To fix this issue, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `gf_fs_del` function. In this case, we need to include the `gpac/filter.h` header file.

The fixed code includes the necessary header files and fixes the build issues.
