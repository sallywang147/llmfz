Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "hb-glib.h"  // Include the missing header file
#include "hb.h"
#include "hb-ot.h"

extern "C" {
#include "hb-glib.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string text = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  hb_buffer_t* buffer = hb_buffer_create();
  hb_buffer_add_utf8(buffer, text.c_str(), text.length(), 0, text.length());
  hb_font_t* font = hb_font_create();  // Fix the undefined reference to hb_font_create()
  hb_ot_shape_glyphs_closure(font, buffer, nullptr, 0, nullptr);
  hb_buffer_destroy(buffer);
  hb_font_destroy(font);
  return 0;
}
```
In this fixed code:

1. We added `#include "hb-glib.h";` at the beginning of the code to include the missing header file.
2. We fixed the undefined reference to `hb_font_create()` by including the necessary header file.

Now, the code should compile and run without any errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
