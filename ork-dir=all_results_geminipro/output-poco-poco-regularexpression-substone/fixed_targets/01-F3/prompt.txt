Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "Poco/RegularExpression.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/FormatVariadic.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  Poco::RegularExpression re(".*");
  std::string replacement("replacement");
  size_t count = re.substOne(&input, 0, &replacement, 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `llvm/Support/FormatVariadic.h` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This header is needed for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, but it is not a C header, so it needs to be wrapped in order to be compatible with the C++ code.

The corrected code wraps the `#include` directive for `llvm/Support/FormatVariadic.h` with `extern "C" {}`, which allows the C++ compiler to link to the header correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
