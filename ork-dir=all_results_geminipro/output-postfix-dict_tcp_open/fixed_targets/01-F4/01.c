The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'dict_tcp_open'
error: undefined reference to 'dict_free'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of the functions `dict_tcp_open` and `dict_free`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library that contains these functions is linked with our program.

In this case, the library is called `dict` and it is located in the file `dict.h`. We can link it with our program by adding the following line to the top of our source file:

```
#include "dict.h"
```

This will tell the linker to look for the `dict` library when it is building our program.

Once we have added this line, we should be able to build our program without errors.
