```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "archive.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  Archive archive;
  bool success = archive.WCheckOpen(const_cast<int *>(stream.ConsumeIntegral<int *>()),
                                  stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes());
  if (success) {
    archive.Close();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to `printf'
```
This means that the `printf` function is being used in the code, but it is not defined in any of the included libraries. To fix this, the `stdio.h` header needs to be included in the code. However, since `stdio.h` is a C library, it needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to be compatible with the C++ code.

The corrected code includes the `stdio.h` header wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which allows the `printf` function to be used in the code.
