Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "TpmTcpProtocol.h"
#ifdef TPM_WINDOWS
#include "TcpServer_fp.h"
#endif
#ifdef TPM_POSIX
#include "TcpServerPosix_fp.h"
#endif

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int PortNumber = 0;
  int PortNumberPlatform = 0;

  if (Data == NULL || Size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  StartTcpServer(&PortNumber, &PortNumberPlatform);

  std::vector<uint8_t> input_buffer(Data, Data + Size);

  while (!input_buffer.empty()) {
    size_t next_size = input_buffer.size();
    if (next_size > 1024) {
      next_size = 1024;
    }
    auto next_input = input_buffer.data();
    input_buffer.erase(input_buffer.begin(),
                       input_buffer.begin() + next_size);

    TpmTcpProtocol_ReceiveBytes(next_input, next_size);
  }

  TpmTcpProtocol_Close();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `StartTcpServer` function is not defined.
2. The `TpmTcpProtocol_ReceiveBytes` function is not defined.
3. The `TpmTcpProtocol_Close` function is not defined.

To fix these issues, we need to include the necessary header files for these functions.

For the `StartTcpServer` function, we need to include the `TcpServer.h` header file.
For the `TpmTcpProtocol_ReceiveBytes` and `TpmTcpProtocol_Close` functions, we need to include the `TpmTcpProtocol.h` header file.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
