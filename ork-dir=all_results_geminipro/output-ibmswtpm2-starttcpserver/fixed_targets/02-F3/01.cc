The original code had the following issues:

* The header file `TcpServer.h` was included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This caused a conflict when linking the object files, as the linker could not determine which definition of the functions and variables in `TcpServer.h` to use.
* The function `StartTcpServer` was declared with the `extern "C"` wrapper, but the definition of the function in `TcpServer.h` was not wrapped with `extern "C"`. This caused a linker error, as the linker could not find a definition for the function `StartTcpServer` that matched the declaration.

To fix these issues, the code was modified as follows:

* The header file `TcpServer.h` was included only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper. This ensures that there is only one definition of the functions and variables in `TcpServer.h`, and that the linker can find the correct definition for the function `StartTcpServer`.
* The definition of the function `StartTcpServer` in `TcpServer.h` was wrapped with `extern "C"`. This ensures that the linker can find the correct definition for the function `StartTcpServer` that matches the declaration.

With these changes, the code should now compile and link successfully.
