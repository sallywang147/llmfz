Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code has the following issues:

1. The function `after_poll` is declared as `extern "C"`, but it is not defined anywhere in the code.
2. The function `poll` is declared in the header `<poll.h>`, but it is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

To fix these issues, we can define the function `after_poll` and wrap the `#include` directive for `<poll.h>` with `extern "C" {}`.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <poll.h>

void after_poll(struct pollfd * pfd, size_t npfd, int maxfds) {
  // Do something after poll()
}
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<struct pollfd> pfd_vector;
  size_t npfd = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < npfd; i++) {
    struct pollfd pfd;
    pfd.fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
    pfd.events = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
    pfd.revents = 0;
    pfd_vector.push_back(pfd);
  }

  int maxfds = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1000);

  poll(pfd_vector.data(), npfd, maxfds);

  after_poll(pfd_vector.data(), npfd, maxfds);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
