Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "flexdef.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  int size_to_alloc = data[0];
  if (size_to_alloc < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  char *ptr = yy_flex_xmalloc(size_to_alloc);
  if (ptr == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  free(ptr);
  return 0;
}
```
The build error message indicates that the `printf` function is missing. To fix this, we need to include the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the declaration for `printf`. However, since we are using C++ code, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to avoid name mangling issues. This is because `stdio.h` is a C header file, and C++ uses a different name mangling scheme than C.

After adding the `stdio.h` header file, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
