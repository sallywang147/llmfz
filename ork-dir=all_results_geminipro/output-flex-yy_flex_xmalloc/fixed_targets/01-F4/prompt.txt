Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>

extern "C" {
#include "flexdef.h"
}

extern "C" char *yy_flex_xmalloc(int size) {
  return static_cast<char *>(malloc(size));
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  int alloc_size = *(reinterpret_cast<const int *>(data));
  data += sizeof(int);
  size -= sizeof(int);
  char *buf = yy_flex_xmalloc(alloc_size);
  if (buf == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(buf, data, size);
  free(buf);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `#include` directive for `flexdef.h` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
* The `yy_flex_xmalloc` and `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` functions were declared as `extern "C"`.

These changes tell the compiler that the functions and variables in `flexdef.h` are defined in C, not C++, and that the `yy_flex_xmalloc` and `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` functions are also defined in C. This allows the code to be compiled and linked successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
