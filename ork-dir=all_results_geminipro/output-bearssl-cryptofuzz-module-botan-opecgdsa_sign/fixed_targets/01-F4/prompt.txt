Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "cryptofuzz.h"

extern "C" {
#include "botan_ecdsa.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  cryptofuzz::module::Botan::OpECGDSA_Sign(nullptr, nullptr, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t*>());
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had an issue in the `cryptofuzz::module::Botan::OpECGDSA_Sign` function call. It was missing the `message` argument, which is required for the function to work correctly.

The fixed code adds the `message` argument to the function call, using the `ConsumeRemainingBytes` method of the `FuzzedDataProvider` to obtain the message data from the input. This ensures that the function is called with all the necessary arguments and should resolve the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
