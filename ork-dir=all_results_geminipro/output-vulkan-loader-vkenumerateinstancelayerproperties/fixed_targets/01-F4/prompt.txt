Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "loader.h"

extern "C" {
#include <vulkan/vulkan.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int count = 0;
  VkLayerProperties *props = NULL;
  int result = vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(&count, props);
  if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }

  props = (VkLayerProperties *)malloc(sizeof(VkLayerProperties) * count);
  result = vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(&count, props);
  if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
    return 0;
  }

  free(props);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties` function is a C function, and it needs to be declared as such in C++. This was done by wrapping the `#include <vulkan/vulkan.h>` line with `extern "C" {}`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
