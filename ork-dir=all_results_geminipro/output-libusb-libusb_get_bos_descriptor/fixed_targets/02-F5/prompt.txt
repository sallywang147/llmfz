Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "libusb/libusb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct libusb_device_handle *dev_handle = NULL;
  struct libusb_bos_descriptor *bos = NULL;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int ret;

  ret = libusb_init(NULL);
  if (ret != LIBUSB_SUCCESS) {
    return ret;
  }

  ret = libusb_get_device_descriptor(dev_handle, NULL);
  if (ret != LIBUSB_SUCCESS) {
    return ret;
  }

  ret = libusb_get_bos_descriptor(dev_handle, &bos);
  if (ret != LIBUSB_SUCCESS) {
    return ret;
  }

  libusb_free_bos_descriptor(bos);

  libusb_exit(NULL);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* `libusb_init` was added to initialize the libusb library.
* `libusb_get_device_descriptor` was changed to pass `dev_handle` as the first argument.
* `libusb_exit` was added to free the resources allocated by the libusb library.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
