Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include "libusb/libusb.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libusb/libusb.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct libusb_device_handle *dev_handle = nullptr;
  struct libusb_bos_descriptor *bos = nullptr;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  uint8_t bmRequestType = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  uint8_t bRequest = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  uint16_t wValue = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>();
  uint16_t wIndex = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>();
  uint16_t wLength = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>();
  std::string input = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  const char *d = input.c_str();

  libusb_fill_control_setup((unsigned char *)d, bmRequestType, bRequest, wValue, wIndex, wLength);

  int ret = libusb_get_bos_descriptor(dev_handle, &bos);
  if (ret != LIBUSB_SUCCESS) {
    // Handle the error appropriately
    return -1;
  }

  libusb_free_bos_descriptor(bos);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <libusb/libusb.h>` line to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the symbols defined in the header file.


2. Initialized `dev_handle` to `nullptr` before using it.


3. Checked the return value of `libusb_get_bos_descriptor` and handled the case where the function fails.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
