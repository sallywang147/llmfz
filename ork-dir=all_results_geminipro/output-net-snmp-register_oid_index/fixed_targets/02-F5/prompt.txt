Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "oid_index.h"  // Include the header file that defines `register_oid_index`
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t value_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  std::vector<size_t> name;
  std::vector<size_t> value;

  for (size_t i = 0; i < name_len; ++i) {
    name.push_back(stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>());
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < value_len; ++i) {
    value.push_back(stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>());
  }

  register_oid_index(name.data(), name_len, value.data(), value_len);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made:

* The header file `oid_index.h` is included within an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the function `register_oid_index` is defined in a C file, and the C++ compiler needs to be told that it is a C function.
* The function `register_oid_index` is declared with `extern "C"`. This is also necessary because the function is defined in a C file.

With these changes, the code should build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
