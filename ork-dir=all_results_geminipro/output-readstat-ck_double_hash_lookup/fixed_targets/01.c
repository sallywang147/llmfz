extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const double key = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  struct ck_hash_table_s* table = ck_hash_init(CK_MD5_HASH);
  char* result = ck_hash_double_lookup(table, &key);  // Fix: Pass the key as the second argument.
  ck_hash_destroy(table);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. The `ck_hash_double_lookup` function was called with the correct arguments.
2. The `result` variable was declared as a `char*` to match the return type of `ck_hash_double_lookup`.
