Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "ck_hash.h"
#include "ck_md5.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const double key = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  struct ck_hash_table_s* table = ck_hash_init(CK_MD5_HASH);
  char* result = ck_double_hash_lookup(table, key);
  ck_hash_destroy(table);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `ck_double_hash_lookup` function expects the table as the first argument, but the code passed the key as the first argument.
2. The `ck_double_hash_lookup` function returns a `char*`, but the code declared `result` as a `char**`.

The fixed code corrects these issues and should now compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
