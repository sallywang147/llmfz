Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace fuzzing {
namespace datasource {

class Datasource {
 public:
  virtual void get(std::vector* this_vector, Datasource* min, size_t max, size_t id,
           size_t) = 0;
  virtual ~Datasource() = default;
};

extern "C" void get(std::vector* this_vector, Datasource* min, size_t max, size_t id,
           size_t) {
  this_vector->resize(max);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < max; i++) {
    (*this_vector)[i] = static_cast<uint8_t>(id);
  }
}

}  // namespace datasource
}  // namespace fuzzing

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  fuzzing::datasource::Datasource min;
  const size_t max = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t id = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<uint8_t> this_vector;
  fuzzing::datasource::get(&this_vector, &min, max, id, 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. The `get` function was moved outside of the `datasource` namespace and declared as `extern "C"` to make it visible to the C++ compiler. This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared in C and cannot call C++ functions directly.
2. The `get` function was declared as `extern "C"` in the `datasource` namespace. This is necessary because the `get` function is defined in the `datasource` namespace, but it is called from the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is not in the `datasource` namespace.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
