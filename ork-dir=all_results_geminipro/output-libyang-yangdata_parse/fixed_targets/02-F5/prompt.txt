Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libyang.h"

extern "C" {
#include "yangdata.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(uint8_t const *buf, size_t len) {
  struct lysp_ctx *pctx = NULL;
  struct lysp_ext_instance *ext = NULL;
  static bool log = false;

  if (!log) {
    ly_log_options(0);
    log = true;
  }

  ext = lysp_ext_instance_new();
  if (ext == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create ext instance\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  pctx = lysp_parse_mem(NULL, buf, len);
  if (pctx == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse data\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  yangdata_parse(pctx, ext);

  lysp_ext_instance_free(ext);
  lysp_ctx_destroy(pctx);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `yangdata.h` header file was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `yangdata_parse()` function was declared in the `yangdata.h` header file.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
