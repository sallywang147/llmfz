Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libyang.h"
#include "yangdata.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(uint8_t const *buf, size_t len) {
  struct lysp_ext_instance *ext = NULL;
  struct lysp_ctx *pctx = NULL;
  LY_ERR err;

  err = lysp_parse_mem(NULL, buf, len, LYS_IN_YANG, &pctx);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse schema\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  err = lysp_ext_instance_new(&ext);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create extension instance\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  err = yangdata_parse(pctx, ext);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse data\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  lysp_ext_instance_free(ext);
  lysp_ctx_free(pctx);

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the `yangdata.h` header file, which contains the definition of the `lysp_ext_instance_new` function. This resolves the issue of the function being undefined and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
