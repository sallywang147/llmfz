Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "planner.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct planner_s ego;
  ego.x = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.y = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.theta = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.v = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.psi = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  struct scanner_s sc;
  sc.num_readings = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  sc.readings = new double[sc.num_readings];
  for (int i = 0; i < sc.num_readings; i++) {
    sc.readings[i] = stream.ConsumeIntegral<double>();
  }

  int result = planner(&ego, &sc);
  delete[] sc.readings;
  return result;
}

int imprt(struct planner_s * ego, struct scanner_s * sc) {
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The function `imprt` was defined.
2. The function `imprt` was called inside the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
