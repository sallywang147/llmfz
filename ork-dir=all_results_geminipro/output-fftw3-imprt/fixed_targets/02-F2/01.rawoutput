```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "planner.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct planner_s ego;
  ego.x = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.y = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.theta = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.v = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  ego.psi = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  struct scanner_s sc;
  sc.num_readings = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  sc.readings = new double[sc.num_readings];
  for (int i = 0; i < sc.num_readings; i++) {
    sc.readings[i] = stream.ConsumeIntegral<double>();
  }

  int result = planner(&ego, &sc);  // Fix: Change imprt to planner
  delete[] sc.readings;
  return result;
}
```

The issues and fixes are as follows:

1. The error message indicates that `planner` is undefined. This is because the function is declared in the header file `planner.h`, but it is not defined in the source file. To fix this, you need to add the definition of the function to the source file.

2. The error message also indicates that `planner` is not declared in the current scope. This is because the function is declared in the header file `planner.h`, but it is not included in the source file. To fix this, you need to add the following line to the top of the source file:

```c++
#include "planner.h"
```

After making these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
