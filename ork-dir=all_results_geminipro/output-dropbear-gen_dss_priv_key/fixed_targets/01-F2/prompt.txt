Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "dss.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int key_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1024);
  struct dropbear_DSS_Key* key = gen_dss_priv_key(key_size);
  dropbear_dss_key_free(key);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is caused by the `dss.h` header file not being wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. To fix this, the `#include "dss.h"` line is wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the C++ compiler will not mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in the header file, which is necessary for the linker to be able to find them.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
