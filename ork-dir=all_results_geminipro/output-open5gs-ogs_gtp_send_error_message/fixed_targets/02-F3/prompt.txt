Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "fuzzing.h"
#include "ogs-gtp.h"

#define kMinInputLength 5
#define kMaxInputLength 1024

extern "C" {
#include "ogs-log.h"
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { /* open5gs/tests/non3gpp/gtp-path.c */

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    initialize();
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_gtp_domain, "gtp", OGS_LOG_NONE);
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_tlv_domain, "tlv", OGS_LOG_NONE);
    initialized = true;
  }

  ogs_gtp_xact_t *xact;
  xact = ogs_gtp_xact_new();

  if (xact == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  int teid = 0;
  char type = 0;
  char cause_value = 0;

  ogs_gtp_send_error_message(xact, teid, type, cause_value);

  ogs_gtp_xact_free(xact);

  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the `initialize()` function is called inside the `if (!initialized)` block to ensure that it is only called once, before any fuzzing tests are run. This fixes the issue of multiple calls to `initialize()`, which was causing the error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
