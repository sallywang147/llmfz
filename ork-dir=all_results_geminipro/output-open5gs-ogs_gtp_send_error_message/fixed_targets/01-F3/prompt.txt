Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "fuzzing.h"
#include "ogs-gtp.h"

#define kMinInputLength 5
#define kMaxInputLength 1024

extern "C" {
#include "ogs-log.h"
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { /* open5gs/tests/non3gpp/gtp-path.c */

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    initialize();
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_gtp_domain, "gtp", OGS_LOG_NONE);
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_tlv_domain, "tlv", OGS_LOG_NONE);
    initialized = true;
  }

  ogs_gtp_xact_t xact;
  int teid = 0;
  char type = 0;
  char cause_value = 0;

  ogs_gtp_send_error_message(&xact, teid, type, cause_value);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that the variable `initialized` is declared as `static` inside the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which means it will be initialized to `false` every time the function is called, causing the logging domains to be installed multiple times. This is incorrect and can lead to undefined behavior.

To fix this issue, the `initialized` variable should be declared as `static` outside of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, so that it is initialized only once when the program starts. This ensures that the logging domains are installed only once, which is the correct behavior.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
