Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "muduo/base/TimeZone.h"

extern "C" {
#include "muduo/base/TimeZoneFile.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  muduo::TimeZone::Data tz_data;
  bool ret = muduo::detail::readTimeZoneFile(new_str, &tz_data);
  free(new_str);
  return ret ? 0 : 1;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `muduo/base/TimeZone.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions and variables declared in that header file.
2. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared as `extern "C"`, but the definition is not. This causes the linker to complain about undefined references to the function.

To fix the issues, we need to:

1. Wrap the header file `muduo/base/TimeZone.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
2. Add the `extern "C"` keyword to the definition of the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
