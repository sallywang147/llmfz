The provided code has no build issues, so there is no need to fix it.

To make the code compilable, you may need to include the necessary header files and libraries for the functions and data structures used in the code. However, the specific headers and libraries to include depend on the actual implementation of the functions and data structures, which are not provided in the given code. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific solution without more information.
