Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "avahi-common/defs.h"
#include "avahi-common/error.h"
#include "avahi-common/malloc.h"
#include "avahi-common/timeval.h"
#include "avahi-core/log.h"

extern "C" {
#include "avahi-client/client.h"
#include "avahi-client/lookup.h"
#include "avahi-client/publish.h"
#include "avahi-client/query.h"
#include "avahi-client/service-browser.h"
}

void log_function(AvahiLogLevel level, const char *txt) {}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *hostname;

  avahi_set_log_function(log_function);

  hostname = avahi_get_host_name();
  if (!hostname)
    return 0;

  avahi_free(hostname);
  return 0;
}
```
1. The error message indicates that `avahi_get_host_name_strdup` is not declared in this scope. To fix this, use `avahi_get_host_name` instead.
2. The error message also indicates that `avahi_free` is not declared in this scope. To fix this, include the header `<avahi-common/malloc.h>` which declares `avahi_free`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
