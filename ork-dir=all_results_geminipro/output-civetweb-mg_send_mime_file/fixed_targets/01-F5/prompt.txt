Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "mongoose.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string mime_type = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct mg_connection conn;
  memset(&conn, 0, sizeof(conn));

  mg_send_mime_file(&conn, path.c_str(), mime_type.c_str());

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `mg_send_mime_file` function takes `char*` arguments, but the `path` and `mime_type` variables were `std::string` objects. To fix this, the `c_str()` method was used to convert the `std::string` objects to `char*` arrays.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
