Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "mongoose.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct mg_connection *conn = mg_create_connection();
  char *path = stream.ConsumeString().c_str();
  char *mime_type = stream.ConsumeString().c_str();
  mg_send_file(conn, path, mime_type);  // Fix: Use mg_send_file instead of mg_send_mime_file
  mg_close_connection(conn);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had an issue with the function `mg_send_mime_file`. This function is not part of the Mongoose library, so it caused the build error. The fix is to use `mg_send_file` instead, which is the correct function for sending files with Mongoose.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
