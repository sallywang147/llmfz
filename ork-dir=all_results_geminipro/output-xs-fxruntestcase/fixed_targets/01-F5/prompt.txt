Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "fxlib.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct sxPool* pool = nullptr;
  struct sxContext* context = nullptr;
  const std::string path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int async = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string message = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = fxRunTestCase(pool, context, path.c_str(),
                            flags, async, message.c_str());
  return result;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `fxRunTestCase` function expects `char*` arguments, but the `path` and `message` variables are of type `std::string`. To fix this, we need to convert these variables to `char*` before passing them to the function. We can do this using the `c_str()` method of the `std::string` class.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
