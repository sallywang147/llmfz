int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *ns = malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ns, data, size);
  ns[size] = '\0';

  parse_complex_format_second(ns);

  free(ns);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `parse_complex_format.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions that are being called from C++ code.
2. The function `parse_complex_format_second` is not defined.

To fix the first issue, the following line is added to the top of the file:

```c++
extern "C" {
```

And the following line is added to the bottom of the file:

```c++
}
```

This wraps the entire header file with `extern "C" {}`, which tells the compiler that the functions in the header file are C functions.

To fix the second issue, the following line is added to the bottom of the file:

```c++
void parse_complex_format_second(char *str);
```

This defines the function `parse_complex_format_second`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
