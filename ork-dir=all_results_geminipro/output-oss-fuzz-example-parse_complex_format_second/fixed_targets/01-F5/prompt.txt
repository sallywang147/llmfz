Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "char_lib.h"

extern "C" {
#include "parse_complex_format.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *ns = malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ns, data, size);
  ns[size] = '\0';

  parse_complex_format_second(ns);

  free(ns);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `parse_complex_format.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions that are being called from C++ code.
2. The function `parse_complex_format_second` is not defined.

To fix the first issue, the following line is added to the top of the file:

```c++
extern "C" {
```

And the following line is added to the bottom of the file:

```c++
}
```

This wraps the entire header file with `extern "C" {}`, which tells the compiler that the functions in the header file are C functions.

To fix the second issue, the following line is added to the bottom of the file:

```c++
void parse_complex_format_second(char *str);
```

This defines the function `parse_complex_format_second`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
