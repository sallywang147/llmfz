Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <unistd.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  char* ret;
  int result = var_tmp_dir(&ret);
  if (result == 0) {
    free(ret);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The build issue is caused by the missing header file `unistd.h`, which is needed for the function `var_tmp_dir`. To fix this, we need to include this header file in the code. However, since `var_tmp_dir` is a C function, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C compiler can find the function declaration.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
