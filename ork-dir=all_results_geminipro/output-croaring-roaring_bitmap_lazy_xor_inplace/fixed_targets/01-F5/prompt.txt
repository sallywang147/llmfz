Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "roaring/roaring.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t bitmap_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  roaring_bitmap_t* bitmap1 = roaring_bitmap_create();
  roaring_bitmap_t* bitmap2 = roaring_bitmap_create();
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < bitmap_size; i++) {
    const uint32_t value = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
    if (stream.ConsumeBool()) {
      roaring_bitmap_add(bitmap1, value);
    }
    if (stream.ConsumeBool()) {
      roaring_bitmap_add(bitmap2, value);
    }
  }
  roaring_bitmap_lazy_xor_inplace(bitmap1, bitmap2);
  roaring_bitmap_free(bitmap1);
  roaring_bitmap_free(bitmap2);
  return 0;
}
```
The original code has the following issues:

1. The `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive is missing. This directive is necessary to include the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, which is used to parse the input data.
2. The `extern "C" {}` directive is missing around the `#include "roaring/roaring.h"` directive. This directive is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the names of the functions and variables defined in the `roaring` library, which is written in C.

The fixed code includes the necessary directives and wraps the `#include "roaring/roaring.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
