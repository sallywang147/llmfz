Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "lzo/lzo1y.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t in_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const size_t out_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const size_t wrkmem_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const size_t dict_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  char* in = new char[in_len];
  char* out = new char[out_len];
  char* wrkmem = new char[wrkmem_len];
  char* dict = new char[dict_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(in, in_len);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(out, out_len);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(wrkmem, wrkmem_len);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(dict, dict_len);
  int ret = lzo1y_999_compress_dict(in, in_len, out, &out_len, wrkmem, dict,
                                    dict_len);
  delete[] in;
  delete[] out;
  delete[] wrkmem;
  delete[] dict;
  return ret;
}
```
The original code has the following issues:

1. The `lzo1y.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C functions that need to be accessible from C++ code.
2. The `lzo1y_999_compress_dict` function is not declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C header file and needs to be accessible from C++ code.

The fixed code wraps the `lzo1y.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and declares the `lzo1y_999_compress_dict` function as `extern "C"`. This allows the code to build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
