Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "Fuzz_http.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  if (Size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  nxt_task_s task;
  nxt_memzero(&task, sizeof(task));
  task.port = 1;

  nxt_port_recv_msg_s msg;
  nxt_memzero(&msg, sizeof(msg));
  msg.data = (uint8_t *)Data;
  msg.len = Size;

  nxt_main_port_modules_handler(&task, &msg);

  return 0;
}

void nxt_main_port_modules_handler(struct nxt_task_s *task,
                                  struct nxt_port_recv_msg_s *msg) {
  nxt_port_recv_msg_s *recv_msg;
  nxt_port_send_msg_s *send_msg;
  nxt_port_t *port;
  nxt_port_module_t *m;

  port = &task->ports[task->port];
  recv_msg = msg;

  for (m = port->modules; m; m = m->next) {
    if (m->recv_msg) {
      send_msg = m->recv_msg(m, recv_msg);
      if (send_msg) {
        nxt_port_send_msg(task, send_msg);
      }
    }
  }
}

extern "C" void nxt_port_send_msg(struct nxt_task_s *task,
                                 struct nxt_port_send_msg_s *msg) {}

extern "C" void nxt_memzero(void *ptr, size_t size) { memset(ptr, 0, size); }
```

The issue was that the header file `nxt_port.h` was not included. This header file contains the declarations for the `nxt_port_t` and `nxt_port_module_t` structs, which are used in the `nxt_main_port_modules_handler` function.

To fix the issue, the following line was added to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "nxt_port.h"
```

This line includes the `nxt_port.h` header file, which contains the declarations for the `nxt_port_t` and `nxt_port_module_t` structs.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
