Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include <libusb/libusb.h>
#include <libusb/libusbi.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct libusb_device_handle *dev_handle = NULL;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  char desc_index = stream.ConsumeIntegral<char>();
  short langid = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  int length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1024);
  std::string input = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  char *d = new char[length + 1];
  memset(d, 0, length + 1);
  memcpy(d, input.c_str(), input.size());

  // Open the first USB device found
  libusb_init(NULL);
  libusb_device **devs; // pointer to pointer of device, used to retrieve a list of devices
  libusb_get_device_list(NULL, &devs); //get the list of devices
  dev_handle = libusb_open(devs[0], NULL); //open the first device

  int ret = libusb_get_string_descriptor(dev_handle, desc_index, langid, d, length);

  libusb_free_device_list(devs, 1); //free the list, unref the devices in it
  libusb_close(dev_handle); //close the device we opened
  libusb_exit(NULL); //deinit the library

  delete[] d;
  return ret;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `libusb` library is properly linked to the program by adding the `-l libusb` flag to the linker command. This is done by adding the following line to the build command:

```
-l libusb
```

2. The `dev_handle` variable is initialized to a valid USB device handle by calling the `libusb_open` function. This is done by adding the following lines to the code:

```c++
libusb_init(NULL);
libusb_device **devs; // pointer to pointer of device, used to retrieve a list of devices
libusb_get_device_list(NULL, &devs); //get the list of devices
dev_handle = libusb_open(devs[0], NULL); //open the first device
```

With these changes, the program should now compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
