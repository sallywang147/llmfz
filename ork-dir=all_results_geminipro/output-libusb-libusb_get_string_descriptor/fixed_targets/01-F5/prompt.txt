Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "libusb/libusb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct libusb_device_handle *dev_handle = nullptr;  // Initialize to nullptr to avoid using an uninitialized variable
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  char desc_index = stream.ConsumeIntegral<char>();
  short langid = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  char *data_ptr = new char[size];
  int length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, size);

  int ret = libusb_get_string_descriptor(dev_handle, desc_index, langid, data_ptr, length);

  delete[] data_ptr;
  return ret;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Initialized `dev_handle` to `nullptr` to avoid using an uninitialized variable. It is not possible to provide a valid `libusb_device_handle` without additional context, such as the USB device to connect to.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
