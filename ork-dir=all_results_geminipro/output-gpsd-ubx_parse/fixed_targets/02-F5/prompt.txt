Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "gpsd.h"
#include "ubx.h" // Include the ubx.h header

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) { // gpsd/tests//test_packet.c
  if (size < 10 || size > 9216) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct gps_device_t device;
  memset(&device, 0, sizeof(device));
  device.lexer.state = GPS_WAITING;

  std::vector<char> input_buffer(size);
  memcpy(input_buffer.data(), data, size);
  size_t parsed = ubx_parse(&device, input_buffer.data(), size);
  return parsed;
}
```

The issue here is that the `ubx.h` header is not included in the code. To fix this, we need to add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include "ubx.h"
```

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
