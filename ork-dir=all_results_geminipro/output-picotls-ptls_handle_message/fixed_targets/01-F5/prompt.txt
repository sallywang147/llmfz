Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <assert.h>
#include <getopt.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <openssl/engine.h>
#include <openssl/err.h>
#include <openssl/ptls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <openssl/ptls.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct st_ptls_t *tls = NULL;
  struct st_ptls_buffer_t sendbuf;
  size_t epoch_offsets[100];
  struct st_ptls_handshake_properties_t properties;
  ptls_handshake_properties_init(&properties);

  ptls_init(PTLS_SERVER_MODE, &tls);
  ptls_buffer_init(&sendbuf, 8192);

  ptls_handle_message(tls, &sendbuf, epoch_offsets, 0, (char *)data, size, &properties);

  ptls_buffer_dispose(&sendbuf);
  ptls_free(&tls);
  ptls_handshake_properties_free(&properties);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ptls.h` header is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can cause linker errors.
2. The `ptls_init()` function is called with the wrong argument order. It should be `ptls_init(PTLS_SERVER_MODE, &tls);`.

The fixed code addresses these issues by including the `ptls.h` header only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper, and by calling the `ptls_init()` function with the correct argument order.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
