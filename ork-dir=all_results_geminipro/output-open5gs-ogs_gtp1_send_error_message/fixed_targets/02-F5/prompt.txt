Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "fuzzing.h"
#include "ogs-gtp.h"

#define kMinInputLength 5
#define kMaxInputLength 1024

extern "C" {
#include "ogs-gtp-internal.h"
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { /* open5gs/tests/non3gpp/gtp-path.c */

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  if (!initialized) {
    initialize();
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_gtp_domain, "gtp", OGS_LOG_NONE);
    ogs_log_install_domain(&__ogs_tlv_domain, "tlv", OGS_LOG_NONE);
  }

  ogs_gtp_xact_t xact;
  ogs_gtp1_send_error_message(&xact, 0x1234, 0x56, 0x78);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ogs_gtp1_send_error_message` function is declared in the `ogs-gtp-internal.h` header, which is included with `extern "C" {}`. However, the function definition is missing. To fix this, the function definition should be added to the `ogs-gtp-internal.h` header or to a separate header file that is included with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The `initialize` function is declared in the `ogs-gtp.h` header, which is included without `extern "C" {}`. This means that the linker will not be able to find the definition of the `initialize` function, which is likely defined in a C++ source file. To fix this, the `#include` directive for `ogs-gtp.h` should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

The fixed code includes the `ogs-gtp1_send_error_message` function definition in the `ogs-gtp-internal.h` header and wraps the `#include` directive for `ogs-gtp.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This should fix the build issues and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
