Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "http_parser.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  int http_errno = data[0];
  const char *description = http_errno_description(http_errno);
  if (description != NULL) {
    free((void *)description);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a bug that it tries to free a null pointer if the `http_errno_description` function returns `NULL`. To fix this, a check is added to ensure that `description` is not `NULL` before freeing it.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
