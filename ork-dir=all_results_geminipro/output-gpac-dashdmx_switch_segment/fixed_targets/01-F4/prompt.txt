Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the function `dashdmx_switch_segment` is not declared in the header file `gpac/dashdmx.h`. To fix this, you need to include the header file `gpac/dashdmx_priv.h` which contains the declaration of this function.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "gpac/dashdmx.h"
#include "gpac/dashdmx_priv.h" // Include the header file for dashdmx_switch_segment

extern "C" {
#include "gpac/gf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    gf_init();
    initialized = true;
  }

  GF_DASHDmxCtx *ctx = gf_dashdmx_new();
  if (ctx == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  GF_DASHGroup *group = gf_dashdmx_new_group(ctx, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  if (group == nullptr) {
    gf_dashdmx_delete(ctx);
    return 0;
  }

  dashdmx_switch_segment(ctx, group); // Call the dashdmx_switch_segment function

  gf_dashdmx_delete_group(group);
  gf_dashdmx_delete(ctx);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
