Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pg_query.h>

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libprotobuf-mutator/src/libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  PgQueryProtobufParseResult result = pg_query_parse_protobuf(new_str);
  pg_query_parse_protobuf_opts(&result, new_str, size);

  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `pg_query_parse_protobuf` and `pg_query_parse_protobuf_opts` functions are declared in the `pg_query` header, but they are not defined in the code. This is because the `pg_query` header is a C header, and the functions are defined in a C++ library. To fix this, the `extern "C"` directive is used to wrap the `#include` directive for the `pg_query` header. This tells the compiler that the functions are defined in a C library, and it allows the linker to find them.

2. The `PgQueryProtobufParseResult` type is not defined in the code. This is because it is defined in the `pg_query` header, which is a C header. To fix this, the `extern "C"` directive is used to wrap the `#include` directive for the `pg_query` header. This tells the compiler that the type is defined in a C library, and it allows the linker to find it.

After applying these fixes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
