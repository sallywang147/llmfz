The original code has the following issues:

1. The `pg_query_parse_protobuf` and `pg_query_parse_protobuf_opts` functions are declared in the `pg_query` header, but they are not defined in the code. This is because the `pg_query` header is a C header, and the functions are defined in a C++ library. To fix this, the `extern "C"` directive is used to wrap the `#include` directive for the `pg_query` header. This tells the compiler that the functions are defined in a C library, and it allows the linker to find them.

2. The `PgQueryProtobufParseResult` type is not defined in the code. This is because it is defined in the `pg_query` header, which is a C header. To fix this, the `extern "C"` directive is used to wrap the `#include` directive for the `pg_query` header. This tells the compiler that the type is defined in a C library, and it allows the linker to find it.

After applying these fixes, the code should compile and run successfully.
