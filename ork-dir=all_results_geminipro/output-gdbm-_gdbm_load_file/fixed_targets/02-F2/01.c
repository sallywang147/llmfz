The issues in the original code are:

1. The `ofp` variable is declared as `struct gdbm_file_info**` but is used as `struct gdbm_file_info*` in the call to `_gdbm_load_file`. This is a type mismatch.

2. The `dbf` variable is declared as `struct gdbm_file_info*` but is used as `struct gdbm_file_info**` in the call to `_gdbm_free_file_info`. This is also a type mismatch.

The fixes in the corrected code are:

1. Change the declaration of `ofp` to `struct gdbm_file_info*` to match its usage in the call to `_gdbm_load_file`.

2. Change the usage of `dbf` in the call to `_gdbm_free_file_info` to `&dbf` to match its declaration as a pointer to a pointer.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
