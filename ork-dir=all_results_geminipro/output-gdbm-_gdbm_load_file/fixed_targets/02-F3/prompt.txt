Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "gdbm.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  struct gdbm_file_info* dbf = nullptr;
  struct gdbm_file_info** ofp = nullptr;

  const int replace = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int meta_mask = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  const size_t filename_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto filename = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(filename_size);
  struct dump_file* file = _gdbm_open_dump_file(filename.data(), "r");
  if (file == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  int ret = _gdbm_load_file(file, &dbf, &ofp, replace, meta_mask);
  if (ret == 0) {
    _gdbm_close_dump_file(file);
    _gdbm_free_file_info(dbf);
    _gdbm_free_file_info(*ofp);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issues in the original code are:

1. The `ofp` variable is declared as `struct gdbm_file_info**` but is used as `struct gdbm_file_info*` in the call to `_gdbm_load_file`. This is a type mismatch.

2. The `dbf` variable is declared as `struct gdbm_file_info*` but is used as `struct gdbm_file_info**` in the call to `_gdbm_free_file_info`. This is also a type mismatch.

The fixes in the corrected code are:

1. Change the declaration of `ofp` to `struct gdbm_file_info*` to match its usage in the call to `_gdbm_load_file`.

2. Change the usage of `dbf` in the call to `_gdbm_free_file_info` to `&dbf` to match its declaration as a pointer to a pointer.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
