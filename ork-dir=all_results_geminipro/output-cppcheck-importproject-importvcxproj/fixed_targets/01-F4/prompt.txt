Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no compilation errors. It appears to be a complete and correct implementation of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is the entry point for a fuzzer test. The function takes a buffer of data and its size as input, and then uses a `FuzzedDataProvider` object to parse and manipulate the data.

The `importVcxproj` function is called to import a Visual Studio project file (.vcxproj) and extract information such as the project name, files, root directory, and dependencies. The results are stored in the provided variables.

Overall, the code seems to be functioning as intended and should be able to be compiled and executed without any issues.

Therefore, no changes are required to the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
