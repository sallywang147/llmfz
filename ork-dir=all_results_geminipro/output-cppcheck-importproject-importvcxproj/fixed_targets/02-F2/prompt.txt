Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has the following issues:

- The header file `importproject.h` is not included.
- The function `importVcxproj` is not defined.

To fix the code, include the necessary header file and define the missing function.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

#include "importproject.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::string project_path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::string project_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::set<std::string> project_files;
  std::vector<std::string> project_includes;
  ImportProject import_project;
  import_project.importVcxproj(nullptr, &project_path, &project_files, &project_name,
                               &project_includes);
  return 0;
}
```

The following code defines the missing function `importVcxproj`:

```c++
#include "importproject.h"

void ImportProject::importVcxproj(const std::string *vcxproj_path,
                                  const std::string *project_path,
                                  std::set<std::string> *project_files,
                                  std::string *project_name,
                                  std::vector<std::string> *project_includes) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

With these changes, the code should build and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
