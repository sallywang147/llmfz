Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

#include "importproject.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::string project_path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::string project_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::set<std::string> project_files;
  std::vector<std::string> project_includes;
  ImportProject import_project;
  import_project.importVcxproj(nullptr, &project_path, &project_files, &project_name,
                               &project_includes);
  return 0;
}

void ImportProject::importVcxproj(const std::string *vcxproj_path,
                                  const std::string *project_path,
                                  std::set<std::string> *project_files,
                                  std::string *project_name,
                                  std::vector<std::string> *project_includes) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

The missing header file `importproject.h` is included. The missing function `importVcxproj` is defined. The code should now build and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
