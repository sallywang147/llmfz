Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "GeoLoop.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cellBoundaryCrossesGeoLoop.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  struct GeoLoop geoloop;
  struct BBox loopBBox;
  struct CellBoundary boundary;
  struct BBox boundaryBBox;

  provider.ConsumeBytes(&geoloop, sizeof(geoloop));
  provider.ConsumeBytes(&loopBBox, sizeof(loopBBox));
  provider.ConsumeBytes(&boundary, sizeof(boundary));
  provider.ConsumeBytes(&boundaryBBox, sizeof(boundaryBBox));

  int result = cellBoundaryCrossesGeoLoop(&geoloop, &loopBBox, &boundary, &boundaryBBox);

  return 0;
}
```
The issue was that the function `cellBoundaryCrossesGeoLoop` returned an `int`, but the function prototype in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function declared it to return a `void`. To fix this, the return type of the `cellBoundaryCrossesGeoLoop` function was changed to `int`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
