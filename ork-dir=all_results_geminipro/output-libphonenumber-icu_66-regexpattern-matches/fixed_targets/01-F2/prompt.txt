Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <unicode/regex.h>
#include <unicode/unistr.h>

extern "C" {
#include <unicode/uclean.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);

  UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
  icu::RegexMatcher m(icu::UnicodeString::fromUTF8(fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString()),
                      0, status);
  if (U_FAILURE(status)) {
    return 0;
  }

  m.reset(icu::UnicodeString::fromUTF8(fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString()));
  m.matches(status);

  u_cleanup();

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that it doesn't call `u_cleanup()` to clean up the ICU library before exiting the program. This can lead to memory leaks and other problems.

To fix this issue, we need to add a call to `u_cleanup()` at the end of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. We also need to wrap the `#include <unicode/uclean.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` because it's a C header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
