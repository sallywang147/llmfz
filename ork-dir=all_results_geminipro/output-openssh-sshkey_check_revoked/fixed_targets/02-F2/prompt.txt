Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "sshkey.h"

extern "C" {
#include "sshkey_check_revoked.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string key_string = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  sshkey *key = sshkey_new(key_string.c_str());
  if (key == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const std::string revoked_keys_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = sshkey_check_revoked(key, const_cast<char*>(revoked_keys_file.c_str()));

  sshkey_free(key);

  return result;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `sshkey_check_revoked'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `sshkey_check_revoked`. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function, which is `sshkey_check_revoked.h`.

To do this, we can add the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "sshkey_check_revoked.h"
```

We also need to wrap this `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` because it is a C header file. This is necessary because the C++ compiler uses a different name mangling scheme than the C compiler, and the linker needs to be able to find the function with the correct name.

After making these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
