  }
  ZydisEncoderNopFill(buffer, buffer_size);
  free(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The header file `Zydis/Zydis.h` was included with `extern "C" {}` to allow the linker to find the definition of the `ZydisEncoderNopFill` function.
* The function `ZydisEncoderNopFill` was declared with `extern "C"` to allow the linker to find its definition.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.
