```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "Zydis/Zydis.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char* buffer = static_cast<char*>(malloc(buffer_size));
  if (buffer == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  ZydisEncoderNopFill(buffer, buffer_size);
  free(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'ZydisEncoderNopFill'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ZydisEncoderNopFill`. This is because the header file `Zydis/Zydis.h` does not contain the definition of this function. To fix this error, you need to link your program with the library that contains the definition of this function.

In this case, the library that contains the definition of `ZydisEncoderNopFill` is called `libzydis`. You can link your program with this library by adding the following line to your build command:

```
-lzydis
```

For example, if you are using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), you would add the following line to your build command:

```
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lzydis
```

Once you have linked your program with the `libzydis` library, the linker will be able to find the definition of the `ZydisEncoderNopFill` function and the error will be resolved.
