Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "Zydis/Zydis.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char* buffer = static_cast<char*>(malloc(buffer_size));
  if (buffer == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  ZydisEncoderNopFill(buffer, buffer_size);
  free(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `Zydis/Zydis.h` header file is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the functions declared in this header are visible to the linker.

2. The `extern "C"` declaration is removed from the `ZydisEncoderNopFill` function. This is because the function is already declared as `extern "C"` in the `Zydis/Zydis.h` header file.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
