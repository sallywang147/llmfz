}
```
In the original code, `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` was used to close the Zawgyi detector, but it should be `GMTDeleteZawgyiDetector` instead. This is because `GMTDeleteZawgyiDetector` is the correct function to delete the Zawgyi detector, while `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` is used to close the Zawgyi converter.

The corrected code uses `GMTDeleteZawgyiDetector` to delete the Zawgyi detector, which fixes the build error and ensures that the Zawgyi detector is properly cleaned up after use.
