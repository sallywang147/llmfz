Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "public/myanmartools.h"
}

using google_myanmar_tools::ZawgyiDetector;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ZawgyiDetector detector;
  detector.Open();
  // ...
  detector.Close();
  GMTCloseZawgyiDetector(&detector);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` function is not called to close the Zawgyi detector properly. This leads to a memory leak and the error message "The target function `void GMTCloseZawgyiDetector(struct GMTZawgyiDetector * detector)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`".

To fix the issue, the `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` function is called after the `detector.Close()` call. This ensures that the detector is properly closed and the memory is freed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
