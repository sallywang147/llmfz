extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ZawgyiDetector detector;
  detector.Open();
  // ...
  detector.Close();
  GMTCloseZawgyiDetector(&detector);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` function is not called to close the Zawgyi detector properly. This leads to a memory leak and the error message "The target function `void GMTCloseZawgyiDetector(struct GMTZawgyiDetector * detector)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`".

To fix the issue, the `GMTCloseZawgyiDetector` function is called after the `detector.Close()` call. This ensures that the detector is properly closed and the memory is freed.
