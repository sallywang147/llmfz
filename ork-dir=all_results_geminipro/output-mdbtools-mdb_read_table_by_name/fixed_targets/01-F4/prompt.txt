Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code is already correct and has no issues. Therefore, no changes are needed.

```c++
#include <mdbtools.h>
#include <sstream>

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  MdbHandle *mdb = mdb_open_buffer((void *)Data, Size, MDB_NOFLAGS);
  if (mdb) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);
    std::string table_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    struct S_MdbTableDef *table =
        mdb_read_table_by_name(mdb, (char *)table_name.c_str(), MDB_TABLE);
    if (table) {
      mdb_read_columns(table);
      mdb_rewind_table(table);
      while (mdb_fetch_row(table))
        ;
      mdb_free_tabledef(table);
    }
    mdb_close(mdb);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
