Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code is missing the definition of the `dnserv_init` function. To fix this, you need to include the header file that contains the declaration of this function.

Here's the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "dns.h"
#include "dns_types.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct ip4_addr addr;
  provider.ConsumeBytes(&addr, sizeof(addr));
  short port = provider.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  func_type func = (func_type)provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  char result = dnserv_init(&addr, port, func);
  return result;
}
```

Now, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
