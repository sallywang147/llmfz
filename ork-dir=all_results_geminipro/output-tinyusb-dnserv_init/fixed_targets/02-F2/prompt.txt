Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "dns.h"

extern "C" {
#include "dns_types.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct ip4_addr addr;
  provider.ConsumeBytes(&addr, sizeof(addr));
  short port = provider.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  func_type func = (func_type)provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  char result = dnserv_init(&addr, port, func);
  return result;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `dns_types.h` is not included, which is necessary for the definition of `func_type`.
2. The `dnserv_init` function is not declared in the `dns.h` header file.

To fix the code, we need to include the `dns_types.h` header file and wrap the inclusion of `dns.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is because `dns.h` contains C++ code, and we need to tell the compiler to treat it as C code in order to link it with the rest of the C++ code.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
