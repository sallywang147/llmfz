Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "iconv.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string src = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string cd = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int handler = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  char* result = str_cd_iconv(const_cast<char*>(src.c_str()),
                                const_cast<char*>(cd.c_str()), handler);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

* The function `str_cd_iconv` is not declared in the code.

The solution is to include the necessary header file that declares the function. In this case, the header file is `<iconv.h>`, which is already included in the code. However, the header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "iconv.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string src = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string cd = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int handler = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  char* result = str_cd_iconv(const_cast<char*>(src.c_str()),
                                const_cast<char*>(cd.c_str()), handler);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `char * str_cd_iconveh(char * src, struct iconveh_t * cd, int handler)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `char * str_cd_iconveh(char * src, struct iconveh_t * cd, int handler)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
