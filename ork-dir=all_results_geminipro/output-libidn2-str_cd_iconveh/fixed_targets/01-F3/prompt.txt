Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <iconv.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string src = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  iconv_t cd;
  memset(&cd, 0, sizeof(cd));
  const int handler = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  char* result = iconv(cd, const_cast<char*>(src.c_str()), src.length(), nullptr, nullptr);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The function `str_cd_iconveh` is not defined.
2. The function `iconv` is not declared.

To fix the first issue, the `iconv` function is used instead of `str_cd_iconveh`.
To fix the second issue, the `iconv.h` header is included using `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code uses `iconv` instead of `str_cd_iconveh` and includes the `iconv.h` header using `extern "C" {}` to fix the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
