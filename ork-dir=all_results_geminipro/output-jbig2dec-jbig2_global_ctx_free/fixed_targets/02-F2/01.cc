extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t global_ctx_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  Jbig2GlobalCtx* global_ctx =
      static_cast<Jbig2GlobalCtx*>(std::malloc(global_ctx_size));
  if (global_ctx == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  std::memset(global_ctx, 0, global_ctx_size);

  jbig2_global_ctx_free(global_ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has two issues:

1. The header `#include "jbig2.h"` is included twice, once inside the `extern "C" {}` block and once outside. This is not necessary and can lead to build errors.
2. The function `jbig2_global_ctx_free` is declared inside the `extern "C" {}` block, but it is called outside the block. This is not allowed in C++, as the function declaration must be visible before it is called.

To fix these issues, the header `#include "jbig2.h"` should be removed from outside the `extern "C" {}` block, and the function `jbig2_global_ctx_free` should be declared outside the block as well.

The corrected code is shown above.
