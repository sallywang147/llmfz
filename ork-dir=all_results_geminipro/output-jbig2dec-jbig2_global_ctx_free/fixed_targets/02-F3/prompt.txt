Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t global_ctx_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  Jbig2GlobalCtx* global_ctx =
      static_cast<Jbig2GlobalCtx*>(std::malloc(global_ctx_size));
  if (global_ctx == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  std::memset(global_ctx, 0, global_ctx_size);

  jbig2_global_ctx_free(global_ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has two issues:

1. The header `#include "jbig2.h"` is included twice, once inside the `extern "C" {}` block and once outside. This is not necessary and can lead to build errors.
2. The function `jbig2_global_ctx_free` is declared inside the `extern "C" {}` block, but it is called outside the block. This is not allowed in C++, as the function declaration must be visible before it is called.

To fix these issues, the header `#include "jbig2.h"` should be removed from outside the `extern "C" {}` block, and the function `jbig2_global_ctx_free` should be declared outside the block as well.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
