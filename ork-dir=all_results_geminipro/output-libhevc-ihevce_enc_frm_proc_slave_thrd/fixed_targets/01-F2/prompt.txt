Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code has the following build issues:

<error>
error: undefined reference to `ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd'
</error>

The error message indicates that the function `ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd` is not defined. This function is probably defined in a separate C or C++ source file, and it needs to be linked with the current source file in order for the program to build successfully.

To fix this issue, you can add the following line to the top of the source file:

```
extern "C" int ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd(char* pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt);
```

This line declares the function `ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd` as an external function, which means that it is defined in a separate source file. The `extern "C"` directive is necessary because the function is defined in C, and it needs to be called from C++.

Once you have added this line, the program should build successfully.

Here is the complete fixed code:

```
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" int ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd(char* pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt = const_cast<char*>(input.c_str());
  int ret = ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd(pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt);
  return ret;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
