Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "ihevc_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd.h"  // Include the header file

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt = const_cast<char*>(input.c_str());
  int ret = ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd(pv_frm_proc_thrd_ctxt);
  return ret;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. Included the necessary header file `ihevc_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd.h` which declares the `ihevce_enc_frm_proc_slave_thrd` function.
2. Wrapped the `#include` directive for the header file with `extern "C" {}` to ensure proper linking of the object files.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
