Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "njs.h"

extern "C" {
#include "njs_parser.h"
#include "njs_lexer.h"
#include "njs_queue.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct njs_parser_s parser;
  struct njs_lexer_token_t token;
  struct njs_queue_link_s current;
  njs_parser_init(&parser);
  njs_lexer_token_init(&token);
  njs_queue_link_init(&current);
  njs_parser_call_expression(&parser, &token, &current);
  njs_parser_free(&parser);
  njs_lexer_token_free(&token);
  njs_queue_link_free(&current);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the `njs_queue_link_free` function, which is needed to free the memory allocated for the `current` variable. This has been added to the fixed code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
