The issue in the code was that the `getline` function was declared in `<stdio.h>`, but it was not included in the `extern "C"` block. This caused a linker error because the function was not found when linking the program.

To fix this, `<stdio.h>` was added to the `extern "C"` block, ensuring that the `getline` function is included and will be found by the linker.
