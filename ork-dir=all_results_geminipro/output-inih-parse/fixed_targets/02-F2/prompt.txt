Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

void parse(char *fname) {
  FILE *fp;
  char *line = NULL;
  size_t len = 0;
  ssize_t read;

  fp = fopen(fname, "r");
  if (fp == NULL) {
    perror("fopen");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  while ((read = getline(&line, &len, fp)) != -1) {
    // Do something with the line
    printf("%s", line);
  }

  fclose(fp);
  if (line) {
    free(line);
  }
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  std::string filename = fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);
  FILE *fp = fdp.ConsumeFile(filename.c_str());
  if (fp) {
    parse(filename.c_str());
    fclose(fp);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is declared in the `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` header.

To fix this, we have wrapped the `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C-style declarations and definitions, which allows the linker to find the definition of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code should now build and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
