Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <kj/debug.h>
#include "serialize.h"
#include "test-util.h"

extern "C" {
  #include <capnp/test.capnp.h>
}

#include <kj/main.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  kj::ArrayPtr<const uint8_t> array(Data, Size);
  kj::ArrayInputStream ais(array);

  if (kj::none != kj::runCatchingExceptions([&]() {
        capnp::InputStreamMessageReader reader(ais);
        capnp::_::initDynamicTestMessage(reader.getRoot<capnp::DynamicStruct>(capnp::Schema::from<capnp::_::TestAllTypes>()).asBuilder());
        capnp::_::checkDynamicTestMessage(reader.getRoot<capnp::DynamicStruct>(capnp::Schema::from<capnp::_::TestAllTypes>()));
        kj::str(reader.getRoot<capnp::_::TestAllTypes>());
      })) {
    KJ_LOG(ERROR, "threw");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the header `#include <capnp/test.capnp.h>` was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is declared in the header.

To fix the issue, the header `#include <capnp/test.capnp.h>` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the linker to look for the definition of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function in the C++ code, rather than in the C code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
