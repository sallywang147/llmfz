Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "inchi_api.h"

// Define the maximum value for size_t. We return if the fuzzing input is equal
// to kSizeMax because appending the null-terminator to the InChI buffer would
// cause wraparound, thereby initializing the buffer to size 0.
static const size_t kSizeMax = (size_t)-1;

extern "C" {
#include "inchi_api.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size == kSizeMax)
    return 0;

  char *szINCHISource = malloc(sizeof(char) * (size + 1));
  memcpy(szINCHISource, data, size);
  szINCHISource[size] = '\0'; // InChI string must be null-terminated

  inchi_InputINCHI inpInChI;
  inpInChI.szInChI = szINCHISource;
  inpInChI.szOptions = NULL;

  inchi_Output out;
  int ret = GetINCHI(&inpInChI, &out);

  FreeINCHI(&out);
  free(szINCHISource);

  return ret;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `#include` directive for `inchi_api.h` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
* The `GetINCHI` and `FreeINCHI` functions were declared as `extern "C"`.

These changes allow the compiler to find the definition of the `GetINCHI` and `FreeINCHI` functions in the C-style library `inchi_api.h`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
