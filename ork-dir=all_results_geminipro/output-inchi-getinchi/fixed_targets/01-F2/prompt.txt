Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "inchi_api.h"

// Define the maximum value for size_t. We return if the fuzzing input is equal
// to kSizeMax because appending the null-terminator to the InChI buffer would
// cause wraparound, thereby initializing the buffer to size 0.
static const size_t kSizeMax = (size_t)-1;

extern "C" {
#include "inchi_api.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size == kSizeMax)
    return 0;

  char *szINCHISource = malloc(sizeof(char) * (size + 1));
  memcpy(szINCHISource, data, size);
  szINCHISource[size] = '\0'; // InChI string must be null-terminated

  inchi_InputINCHI inpInChI;
  inpInChI.szInChI = szINCHISource;
  inpInChI.szOptions = NULL;

  inchi_Output out;
  int ret = GetINCHI(&inpInChI, &out);

  FreeINCHI(&out);
  free(szINCHISource);

  return ret;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `GetINCHI`
error: undefined reference to `FreeINCHI`
```

The reason for this error is that the functions `GetINCHI` and `FreeINCHI` are declared in the header file `inchi_api.h`, but they are not defined in the source file. To fix this, we need to include the definition of these functions in the source file.

One way to do this is to wrap the `#include` directive for `inchi_api.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to look for the definition of these functions in a C-style library, rather than a C++-style library.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
