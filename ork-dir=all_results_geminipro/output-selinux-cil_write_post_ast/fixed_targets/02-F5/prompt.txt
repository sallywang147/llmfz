Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cil/cil.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cil/cil_internal.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    cil_init();
    initialized = true;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> output_buffer(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0,
      provider.remaining_bytes()));
  auto output_data = provider.ConsumeBytes<unsigned char>(output_buffer.size());
  std::memcpy(output_buffer.data(), output_data.data(), output_data.size());

  struct cil_db* db = cil_db_new();
  cil_db_load_data(db, output_buffer.data(), output_buffer.size());
  cil_write_post_ast(stdout, db);
  cil_db_destroy(db);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary header file `cil/cil_internal.h` for the CIL library. This header file contains declarations for internal functions and data structures used by the CIL library.

The fixed code should resolve the build error and allow the program to compile successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
