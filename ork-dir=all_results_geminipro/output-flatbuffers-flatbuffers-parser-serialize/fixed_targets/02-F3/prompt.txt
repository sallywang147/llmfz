Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  flatbuffers::Parser parser;
  parser.Parse(input.data(), input.size());
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code is shown above. The `Parse` function is now defined in the `flatbuffers::Parser` class, and it takes two arguments: a pointer to the input data and the size of the input data. The function parses the input data and stores the results in the `parser` object.

The `Serialize` function is not defined in the `flatbuffers::Parser` class, so it has been removed from the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
