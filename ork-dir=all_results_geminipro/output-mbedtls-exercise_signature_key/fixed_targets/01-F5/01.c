  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int key = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive is included twice. This is not necessary and can lead to build errors.
2. The `exercise_signature_key` function is not declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the function is called from C code.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

1. Removing the duplicate `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` directive.
2. Declaring the `exercise_signature_key` function as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.
