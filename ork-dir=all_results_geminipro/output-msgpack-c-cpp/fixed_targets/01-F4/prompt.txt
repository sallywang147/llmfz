Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t num_values = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  std::vector<int> values;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_values; ++i) {
    values.push_back(stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>());
  }
  _GLOBAL__sub_I_unpack_pack_fuzzer_cpp(values.data(), values.size());
  return 0;
}
```

The code is fixed by adding the missing header file `<vector>` to the `#include` directives. This header file is necessary for using the `std::vector` container in the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
