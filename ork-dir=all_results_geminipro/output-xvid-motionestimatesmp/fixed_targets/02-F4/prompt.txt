Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "motion_estimation.h"  // Include the header file that contains the definition of MotionEstimateSMP

struct SMPData {
  int32_t width;
  int32_t height;
  int32_t stride;
  uint8_t *data;
};

extern "C" {
#include <motion_estimation.h>  // Wrap the header file with extern "C" {} to resolve the undefined reference error
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  int32_t width = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int32_t>();
  int32_t height = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int32_t>();
  int32_t stride = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int32_t>();
  size_t data_size = width * height * stride;
  uint8_t *data_ptr = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(data_size);

  SMPData h;
  h.width = width;
  h.height = height;
  h.stride = stride;
  h.data = data_ptr;

  MotionEstimateSMP(&h);

  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the `#include <motion_estimation.h>` line is wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the undefined reference error. This is necessary because the `MotionEstimateSMP` function is defined in a C header file, and the C++ compiler needs to be explicitly told to look for it in the C namespace.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
