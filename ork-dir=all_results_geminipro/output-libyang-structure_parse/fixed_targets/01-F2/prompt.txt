Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libyang.h"

extern "C" {
#include "structure.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct lysp_ext_instance *ext = NULL;
  struct lysp_ctx *pctx = NULL;
  LY_ERR err;

  err = lysp_parse_mem(NULL, data, size, LYS_IN_YANG, NULL, &pctx);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse data\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  err = lysp_ext_instance_new(pctx, &ext);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create ext instance\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  err = structure_parse(pctx, ext);
  if (err != LY_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse structure\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  lysp_ext_instance_free(ext);
  lysp_ctx_destroy(pctx);

  return 0;
}
```

The build error message indicates that the function `structure_parse` is undefined. This is because the header file `structure.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file and wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is exported with C linkage.

The corrected code includes the header file `structure.h` and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function `structure_parse` is exported with C linkage and can be found by the linker.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
