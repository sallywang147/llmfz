Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libyang.h"

extern "C" {
#include "structure_parse.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(uint8_t const *buf, size_t len) {
  struct lysp_ctx *pctx = NULL;
  struct lysp_ext_instance *ext = NULL;
  static bool log = false;

  if (!log) {
    ly_log_options(0);
    log = true;
  }

  pctx = lysp_ctx_new(NULL);
  if (!pctx) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create context\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  ext = malloc(sizeof(*ext));
  if (!ext) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to allocate memory for extension instance\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  char *data = malloc(len + 1);
  if (data == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(data, buf, len);
  data[len] = 0;

  int ret = structure_parse(pctx, ext, data);

  lysp_ctx_destroy(pctx);
  free(ext);
  free(data);

  return ret;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'structure_parse'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the `structure_parse` function. This can happen if the function is not defined in any of the object files that are being linked together.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that the definition of the `structure_parse` function is included in one of the object files that are being linked together. This can be done by adding the following line to the top of the `structure_parse.c` file:

```c
extern "C" int structure_parse(struct lysp_ctx *ctx, struct lysp_ext_instance *ext, const char *data);
```

This line tells the compiler that the `structure_parse` function is defined in another object file, and that it should be linked in when the program is built.

Once you have added this line to the `structure_parse.c` file, you should be able to build the program without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
