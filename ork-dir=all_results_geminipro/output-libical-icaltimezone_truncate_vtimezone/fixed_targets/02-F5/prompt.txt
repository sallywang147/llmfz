Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libical/ical.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *ical_string1 = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ical_string1, data, size);
  ical_string1[size] = '\0';

  icalcomponent *ical1 = icalcomponent_new_from_string(ical_string1);
  if (ical1 != NULL) {
    icaltimetype start = {};
    icaltimetype end = {};
    icaltimezone_truncate_vtimezone(ical1, &start, &end, 0);
    icalcomponent_free(ical1); // Free the icalcomponent before freeing the string.
  }
  free(ical_string1);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
