Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "b2nd_array.h"

extern "C" {
#include "b2nd_array.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Initialize B2ND array.
  struct b2nd_array_t *array = b2nd_array_new();
  if (array == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Generate random values for function parameters.
  size_t key_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *key = (char *)malloc(key_size + 1);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(key, key_size);
  key[key_size] = '\0';

  size_t value_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *value = (char *)malloc(value_size + 1);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(value, value_size);
  value[value_size] = '\0';

  char delimiter = stream.ConsumeIntegral<char>();

  size_t max_value_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);

  // Call the function under test.
  int result = b2nd_insert(array, key, key_size, value, value_size, delimiter, max_value_size);

  // Free allocated memory.
  free(key);
  free(value);
  b2nd_array_free(array);

  return result;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `b2nd_array.h` header was included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This caused a compiler error because the function `b2nd_insert` was declared twice with different linkages.
2. The `b2nd_array_new`, `b2nd_insert`, and `b2nd_array_free` functions were declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, but they were not defined with the `extern "C"` linkage. This caused a linker error because the compiler could not find the definitions of these functions.

The fixed code includes the `b2nd_array.h` header only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper. It also defines the `b2nd_array_new`, `b2nd_insert`, and `b2nd_array_free` functions with the `extern "C"` linkage. This ensures that the compiler and linker can find the definitions of these functions.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
