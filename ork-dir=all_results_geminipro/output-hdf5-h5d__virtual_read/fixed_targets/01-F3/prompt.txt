Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <hdf5.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
}

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  hid_t fuzz_h5_id = H5Fopen(filename, H5F_ACC_RDWR, H5P_DEFAULT);
  if (fuzz_h5_id != H5I_INVALID_HID) {
    hid_t dataset_id = H5Dopen2(fuzz_h5_id, "dsetname", H5P_DEFAULT);
    if (dataset_id != H5I_INVALID_HID) {
      H5D_io_info_t io_info;
      H5D_dset_io_info_t dset_io_info;
      H5D__virtual_read(&io_info, &dset_io_info);
      H5Dclose(dataset_id);
    }
    H5Fclose(fuzz_h5_id);
  }
  return 0;
}
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as `extern` but not defined. This means that the linker cannot find the function definition when trying to build the program.
2. The `H5D__virtual_read` function is not declared in the code. This means that the compiler cannot find the function definition when trying to build the program.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Define the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function in the code.
2. Declare the `H5D__virtual_read` function in the code.

We can do this by wrapping the `#include <hdf5.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the compiler to look for the function definitions in the HDF5 library, which is where they are actually defined.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
