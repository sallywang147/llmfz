Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mz.h"
#include "mz_strm.h"
#include "mz_strm_mem.h"
#include "mz_zip.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int error_code;
  int result = mz_zip_validate_file_archive(
      const_cast<char*>(input_file.c_str()), input_file.size(), &error_code);
  return result;
}
```

The original code has a build error because the `mz.h`, `mz_strm.h`, `mz_strm_mem.h`, and `mz_zip.h` headers are not properly included. To fix this, the `extern "C" {}` directive is added to wrap the `#include` directives for these headers. This is necessary because these headers are written in C and not in C++, and the `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to treat them as C headers.

With this change, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
