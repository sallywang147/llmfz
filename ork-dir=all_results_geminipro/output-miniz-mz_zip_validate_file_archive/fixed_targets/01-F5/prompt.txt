Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mz.h"
#include "mz_strm.h"
#include "mz_strm_mem.h"
#include "mz_zip.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int error_code;
  int result = mz_zip_validate_file_archive(
      input_file.c_str(), input_file.size(), &error_code);
  return result;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mz.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions and variables declared in `mz.h`.
2. The `mz_zip_validate_file_archive` function takes a `const char*` as its first argument, but the `input_file` variable is a `std::string`. This causes a compiler error.

To fix these issues, we can:

1. Wrap the `mz.h` header file with `extern "C" {}`.
2. Convert the `input_file` variable to a `const char*` before passing it to the `mz_zip_validate_file_archive` function.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
