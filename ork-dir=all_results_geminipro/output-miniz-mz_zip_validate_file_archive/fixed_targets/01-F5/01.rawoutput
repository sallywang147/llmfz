```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mz.h"
#include "mz_strm.h"
#include "mz_strm_mem.h"
#include "mz_zip.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int error_code;
  int result = mz_zip_validate_file_archive(
      input_file.c_str(), input_file.size(), &error_code);
  return result;
}
```

The corrected code is shown above.
The main difference between the original code and the corrected code is that the `mz.h` header file is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `mz.h` header file contains C declarations, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to treat these declarations as C declarations.

The other difference is that the `input_file` variable is now converted to a `const char*` before it is passed to the `mz_zip_validate_file_archive` function. This is necessary because the `mz_zip_validate_file_archive` function takes a `const char*` as its first argument, and the `input_file` variable is a `std::string`.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.
