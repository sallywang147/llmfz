```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "../cJSON.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size); /* required by C89 */

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size == 0)
    return 0;

  char *copy = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (copy == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(copy, data, size);
  copy[size] = '\0';

  cJSON *json = cJSON_Parse(copy);

  if (json != NULL)
    cJSON_Delete(json);

  free(copy);

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The issue in the original code was that the `cJSON.h` header file was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}` when it was included in the C++ code. This caused the linker to be unable to find the `cJSON_Parse` and `cJSON_Delete` functions when trying to link the object file.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for `cJSON.h` has been wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C code, and that the functions and variables declared in the header file should be treated as C symbols.

With this change, the code should now compile and link successfully.
