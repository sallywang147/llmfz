Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Jbig2Allocator allocator;

  allocator.alloc = NULL;
  allocator.free = jbig2_default_free;
  allocator.realloc = NULL;

  jbig2_default_free(&allocator, (char *)data);
  return 0;
}
```
The issue with the original code is that the `jbig2.h` header file is not properly included. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the `jbig2.h` header file contains C function declarations, and we need to tell the compiler to use the C calling convention when compiling the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code includes the `jbig2.h` header file with `extern "C" {}`, which ensures that the `jbig2_default_free` function is properly declared and can be used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
