extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Jbig2Allocator allocator;

  allocator.alloc = NULL;
  allocator.free = jbig2_default_free;

  jbig2_default_free(&allocator, (char *)data);
  return 0;
}
```
The issue with the original code is that the `jbig2.h` header file is not properly included. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the `jbig2.h` header file contains C function declarations, and we need to tell the compiler to use the C calling convention when compiling the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code includes the `jbig2.h` header file with `extern "C" {}`, which ensures that the `jbig2_default_free` function is properly declared and can be used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
