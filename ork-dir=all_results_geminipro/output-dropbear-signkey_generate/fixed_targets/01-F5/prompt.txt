Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "signkey.h"

extern "C" {
#include "signkey.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const int key_type = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bits = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  signkey_generate(key_type, bits, filename.c_str(), 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The fix is to change `const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str())` to `filename.c_str()`.

The original code has a type mismatch between the `filename` variable and the `signkey_generate` function's `filename` parameter. The `filename` variable is a `std::string`, while the `signkey_generate` function expects a `char*`. The `const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str())` expression was used to convert the `std::string` to a `char*`, but it also made the `filename` variable non-const, which is not allowed because the `signkey_generate` function expects a const `char*`.

The corrected code uses `filename.c_str()` instead of `const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str())` to convert the `std::string` to a `char*` without making the `filename` variable non-const.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
