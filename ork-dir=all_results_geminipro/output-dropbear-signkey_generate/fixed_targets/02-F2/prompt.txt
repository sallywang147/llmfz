Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "dss.h"
#include "ed25519.h"
#include "fuzz.h"
#include "session.h"
#include "signkey.h"
#include "ssh.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int keytype = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bits = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  const int skip_exist = stream.ConsumeBool();

  signkey_generate(keytype, bits, filename.c_str(), skip_exist);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:
- Removed `const_cast` from `filename.c_str()` in the `signkey_generate` function call. This is because `signkey_generate` expects a non-const char* as its third argument.
- Added `#include <cstdio>` to include the `printf` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
