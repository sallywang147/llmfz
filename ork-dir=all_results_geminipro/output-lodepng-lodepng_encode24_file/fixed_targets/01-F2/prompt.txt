Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <lodepng.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Generate a random filename.
  std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);
  filename += ".png";

  // Generate a random image.
  const uint32_t width = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<uint32_t>(1, 1024);
  const uint32_t height = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<uint32_t>(1, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> image(width * height * 3);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(image.data(), image.size());

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  int result = lodepng_encode24_file(filename.c_str(), reinterpret_cast<char*>(image.data()), width, height);
  if (result != 0) {
    // An error occurred.
    return 0;
  }

  // The function returned successfully.
  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the declaration of the `lodepng_encode24_file` function. This is because the header file that declares this function, `lodepng.h`, is not included in the code. To fix this, we need to add the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <lodepng.h>
```

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the `lodepng.h` header file is written in C, and we are compiling the code with a C++ compiler. This ensures that the C++ compiler will not mangle the names of the functions and variables declared in the header file, which would make them inaccessible to the C code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
