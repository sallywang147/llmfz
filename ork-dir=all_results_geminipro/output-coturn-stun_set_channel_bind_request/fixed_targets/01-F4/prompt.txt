Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "stun.h"

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 5120

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data,
                                  size_t Size) { // rfc5769check

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  struct _stun_buffer buf;
  stun_init_buffer(&buf);

  union ioa_addr peer_addr;
  stun_set_channel_bind_request(&buf, &peer_addr, 1);

  stun_free_buffer(&buf);

  return 0;
}
```

The code was missing the necessary header files for the `stun` functions.

To fix the code, the following header files were included:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "stun.h"
```

Additionally, the `stun` functions were wrapped in `extern "C"` to ensure that they are exported with C linkage.

This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with C linkage, and the `stun` functions are declared with C++ linkage by default.

Without the `extern "C"` wrapper, the linker would not be able to find the `stun` functions when trying to resolve the symbols in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
