extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data,

```

The code was missing the necessary header files for the `stun` functions.

To fix the code, the following header files were included:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "stun.h"
```

Additionally, the `stun` functions were wrapped in `extern "C"` to ensure that they are exported with C linkage.

This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with C linkage, and the `stun` functions are declared with C++ linkage by default.

Without the `extern "C"` wrapper, the linker would not be able to find the `stun` functions when trying to resolve the symbols in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
