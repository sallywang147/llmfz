Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "hermes/hermes.h"

extern "C" {
#include "hermes/vm/Callable.h"
#include "hermes/Support/DynamicLinker.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    hermes::vm::initializeHermesVM();
    initialized = true;
  }
  auto runtime = hermes::makeHermesRuntime();
  auto args = hermes::vm::NativeArgs::create(runtime);
  hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction(runtime.get(), args.get(), 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

* The header file `hermes/vm/Callable.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` because it is declared in a C++ header file.
* The function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` is not declared with `extern "C"`. This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` because it is declared in a C++ source file.

To fix the first issue, we need to wrap the header file `hermes/vm/Callable.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the linker to look for the definition of the function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` in a C++ library.

To fix the second issue, we need to declare the function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` with `extern "C"`. This will tell the linker that the function `hermes::vm::createDynamicFunction` is declared in a C++ header file.

With these fixes, the code should build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
