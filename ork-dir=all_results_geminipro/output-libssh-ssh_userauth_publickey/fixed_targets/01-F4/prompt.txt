Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include <libssh/libssh.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libssh/libssh.h>
#include <libssh/ssh.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  ssh_session session;
  session = ssh_new();
  if (session == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error creating SSH session\n");
    return 0;
  }

  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");

  ssh_key privkey;
  ssh_key_init(&privkey);

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  if (provider.ConsumeBool()) {
    // Fuzz the private key.
    ssh_pki_import_privkey_file2(&privkey, "id_rsa", NULL, NULL, NULL);
  } else {
    // Fuzz the public key.
    ssh_pki_import_pubkey_file(&privkey, "id_rsa.pub", NULL);
  }

  int rc = ssh_userauth_publickey(session, NULL, &privkey);
  if (rc != SSH_AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error authenticating with public key: %s\n", ssh_get_error(session));
  }

  ssh_disconnect(session);
  ssh_free(session);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `#include <libssh/ssh.h>` directive was added within the `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the `ssh_userauth_publickey` function is declared in this header.

2. The `ssh_key_init(&privkey)` line was moved inside the `if (session == NULL)` block. This is because the `ssh_key_init` function should only be called after the SSH session has been created successfully.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
