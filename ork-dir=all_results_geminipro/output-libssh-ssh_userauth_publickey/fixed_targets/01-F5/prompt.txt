Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include <libssh/libssh.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libssh/libssh.h>
#include <libssh/ssh.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  ssh_session session;
  session = ssh_new();
  if (session == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error creating SSH session\n");
    return 0;
  }

  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");

  ssh_key privkey;
  if (ssh_key_init(&privkey) != SSH_OK) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error initializing SSH key\n");
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  if (provider.ConsumeBool()) {
    // Fuzz the private key.
    if (ssh_pki_import_privkey_file2(&privkey, "id_rsa", NULL, NULL, NULL) != SSH_OK) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Error importing private key\n");
      return 0;
    }
  } else {
    // Fuzz the public key.
    if (ssh_pki_import_pubkey_file(&privkey, "id_rsa.pub", NULL) != SSH_OK) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Error importing public key\n");
      return 0;
    }
  }

  int rc = ssh_userauth_publickey(session, NULL, &privkey);
  if (rc != SSH_AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error authenticating with public key: %s\n", ssh_get_error(session));
  }

  ssh_disconnect(session);
  ssh_free(session);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `ssh_key_init(&privkey)` line was moved outside the `if (session == NULL)` block. This is because the `ssh_key_init` function should be called before the SSH session is created.

2. The `ssh_pki_import_privkey_file2` and `ssh_pki_import_pubkey_file` functions were wrapped in conditional statements to check the return value and print an error message if the key import failed.

3. The `ssh_free(privkey)` line was removed, as the `ssh_key_free` function is called automatically when the `ssh_key` structure is destroyed.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
