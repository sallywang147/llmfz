Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <dns/dns.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <dns/dns.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  const char* data_ptr = reinterpret_cast<const char*>(bytes.data());
  const size_t data_size = bytes.size();

  struct DNSQuestion q;
  short option_code = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  std::string option_data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  bool ret = setEDNSOption(&q, option_code, option_data.c_str());
  if (ret) {
    // Do something with the result.
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `setEDNSOption` function expects a `const char*` for the `option_data` parameter, but the code was passing a `std::string`. To fix this, the code was updated to use `option_data.c_str()` to convert the `std::string` to a `const char*`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
