Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "log.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdarg.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Log *log = log_new();
  if (log == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  size_t format_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  char *format = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(format_len);
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, format);
  int ret = log_commit_journal(log, format, args);
  va_end(args);
  log_free(log);
  free(format);
  return ret;
}
```
The issue with the original code was that the `va_list` type was being used incorrectly. The `va_list` type is a variable argument list, and it must be declared and initialized before it can be used.

To fix this, the `va_list` variable `args` was declared and initialized using the `va_start()` function. The `va_start()` function takes two arguments: the `va_list` variable to be initialized, and the last fixed argument in the function call. In this case, the last fixed argument is `format`.

After the `va_list` variable has been initialized, it can be used to access the variable arguments in the function call. This is done using the `va_arg()` function. The `va_arg()` function takes two arguments: the `va_list` variable, and the type of the argument to be retrieved. In this case, the type of the argument to be retrieved is `char *`.

Once all of the variable arguments have been retrieved, the `va_end()` function must be called to clean up the `va_list` variable.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
