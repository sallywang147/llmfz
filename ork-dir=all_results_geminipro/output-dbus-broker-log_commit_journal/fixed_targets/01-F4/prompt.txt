Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include "log.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libunwind.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Log *log = NULL;
  int r;

  if (size < sizeof(struct LogHeader))
    return 0;

  r = log_new(&log, (struct LogHeader *)data);
  if (r != 0)
    return 0;

  if (log->n_data > size)
    return 0;

  memcpy(log->data + sizeof(struct LogHeader), data + sizeof(struct LogHeader),
         log->n_data - sizeof(struct LogHeader));

  r = log_commit_journal(log, "%s", data);
  if (r)
    return 0;

  log_unref(log);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the `log.h` header and wraps the `#include <libunwind.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because `libunwind.h` is a C header and needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` when used in C++ code.

The fixed code also declares the `log_new`, `log_unref`, and `log_commit_journal` functions. This is necessary because these functions are not declared in any of the included headers.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
