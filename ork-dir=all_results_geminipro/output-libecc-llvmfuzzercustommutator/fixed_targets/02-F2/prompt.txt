Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator(char* data, size_t size,
                                           size_t max_size, int seed) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t new_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, max_size);
  if (new_size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  char* new_data = reinterpret_cast<char*>(malloc(new_size));
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(new_data, new_size);
  free(data);
  return new_size;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
