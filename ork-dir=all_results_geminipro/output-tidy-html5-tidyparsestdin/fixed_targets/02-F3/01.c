The original code had the following issues:

* The `tidy.h` header was included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is incorrect because it can lead to multiple definitions of the `tidy` functions.
* The `tidyParseBuffer` function was used to parse the input data, but this function is not available in the `tidy.h` header that was included without the `extern "C"` wrapper.

The corrected code fixes these issues by including the `tidy.h` header only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper, and by using the `tidyParseBuffer` function from the `tidy.h` header that was included with the `extern "C"` wrapper.
