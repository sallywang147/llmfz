The issue in the original code was that the `tile_worker_hook` function was declared as `void` in the header file `tile_worker_hook.h`, but it was defined as `extern "C" void` in the C++ code. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler expected the function to have a `C` linkage, but the linker found a function with a `C++` linkage.

To fix this issue, the `tile_worker_hook` function was declared as `extern "C" void` in the header file, so that the linker would expect the function to have a `C` linkage. This allowed the linker to successfully link the C++ code with the C function in the header file.
