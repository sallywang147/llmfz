Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "file.h"
#include "ipp-private.h"
#include "string-private.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <spawn.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 10240

void LoadIPP(char *filename) {
  cups_file_t *fp;
  ipp_t *request;

  request = ippNew();
  fp = cupsFileOpen(filename, "r");

  ippReadIO(fp, (ipp_iocb_t)cupsFileRead, 1, NULL, request);

  cupsFileClose(fp);
  ippDelete(request);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { /*cups/cups/fuzzipp.c*/

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  char filename[256];

  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());
  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }

  fwrite(Data, Size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  cups_http_t *http = cupsHttpNew();
  ipp_t *request = ippNew();
  cupsDoIORequest(http, request, filename, 0, 0);
  cupsHttpDelete(http);
  unlink(filename);

  return 0;
}
```
The original code had the following issues:

1. The `#include` directives for `file.h`, `ipp-private.h`, and `string-private.h` were missing the `extern "C"` wrapper, which is necessary for linking C++ code with C code.

2. The `cupsDoIORequest` function was missing its necessary header file, `<cups/cups.h>`.

To fix these issues, the `#include` directives for `file.h`, `ipp-private.h`, and `string-private.h` were wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, and the `<cups/cups.h>` header file was included before the `cupsDoIORequest` function call.

The corrected code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
