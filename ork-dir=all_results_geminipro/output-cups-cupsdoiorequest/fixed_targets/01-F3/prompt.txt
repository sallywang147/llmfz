Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" {
#include "http.h"
#include "ipp-private.h"
#include "string-private.h"
}

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  char *resource = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString().c_str();
  char *filename = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString().c_str();
  int infile = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int outfile = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  struct _http_s *http = httpNew();
  struct _ipp_s *request = ippNew();

  ippReadFile(filename, request);

  struct _ipp_s *response = cupsDoIORequest(http, request, resource, infile, outfile);

  ippDelete(request);
  ippDelete(response);
  httpFree(http);

  return 0;
}
```
The fixed code includes the necessary header files and wraps them with `extern "C" {}` to ensure proper linking with the object files. The `ippReadFile` function is also called with the correct arguments.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
