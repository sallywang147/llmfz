Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
}

extern "C" int gnutls_session_get_data2(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_datum_t *data, int type);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const uint8_t session_type = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  gnutls_session_t session;
  gnutls_init(&session, session_type);
  const uint8_t data_type = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  gnutls_datum_t datum;
  datum.data = nullptr;
  datum.size = 0;
  const int result = gnutls_session_get_data2(session, &datum, data_type);
  gnutls_deinit(session);
  free(datum.data);
  return result;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The `gnutls_session_get_data2` function was not declared in the `gnutls.h` header.
* The `gnutls_init` and `gnutls_deinit` functions were not declared in the `gnutls.h` header.

To fix these issues, we added the following lines to the top of the file:

```c++
extern "C" int gnutls_session_get_data2(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_datum_t *data, int type);
extern "C" int gnutls_init(gnutls_session_t *session, unsigned int session_type);
extern "C" int gnutls_deinit(gnutls_session_t session);
```

These lines declare the functions in the C language, which is necessary because the `gnutls.h` header is written in C.

With these changes, the program should now compile and run correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
