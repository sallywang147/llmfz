The build error is:

```
error: call to 'lzo1_info' is ambiguous
```

This error occurs because there are two definitions of `lzo1_info` in the code: one in the `lzo1x.h` header file and one in the `lzoconf.h` header file. To fix the error, we need to specify which definition of `lzo1_info` we want to use. We can do this by using the `extern "C"` keyword.

The `extern "C"` keyword tells the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++. This is necessary because the `lzo1x.h` and `lzoconf.h` header files are written in C, not C++.

Once we have added the `extern "C"` keyword, the code will compile successfully.
