Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "lzo/lzoconf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "lzo/lzo1x.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int rbits = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 15);
  int clevel = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 9);
  size_t ret = lzo1_info(&rbits, &clevel);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: call to 'lzo1_info' is ambiguous
```

This error occurs because there are two definitions of `lzo1_info` in the code: one in the `lzo1x.h` header file and one in the `lzoconf.h` header file. To fix the error, we need to specify which definition of `lzo1_info` we want to use. We can do this by using the `extern "C"` keyword.

The `extern "C"` keyword tells the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++. This is necessary because the `lzo1x.h` and `lzoconf.h` header files are written in C, not C++.

Once we have added the `extern "C"` keyword, the code will compile successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
