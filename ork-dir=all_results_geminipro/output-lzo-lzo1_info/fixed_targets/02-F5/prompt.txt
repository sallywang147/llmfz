Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "lzo/lzoconf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "lzo/lzo1x.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int rbits = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 15);
  int clevel = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 9);
  size_t ret = lzo1x_info(&rbits, &clevel);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `lzo1_info` function was changed to `lzo1x_info`. This is the correct function to use for getting information about the LZO algorithm.
* The `extern "C"` keyword was added to the `#include` directive for the `lzo1x.h` header file. This tells the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
