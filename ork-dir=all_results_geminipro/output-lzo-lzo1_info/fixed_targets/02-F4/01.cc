```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `lzo1_info` function was changed to `lzo1x_info`. This is the correct function to use for getting information about the LZO algorithm.
* The `extern "C"` keyword was added to the `#include` directive for the `lzo1x.h` header file. This tells the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
