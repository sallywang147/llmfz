Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "lzo/lzoconf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "lzo/lzo1x.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int rbits = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int clevel = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t ret = lzo1_info_1_15(&rbits, &clevel);  // Fix the function name
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that it used the incorrect function name `lzo1_info` instead of the correct function name `lzo1_info_1_15` for the LZO library version 1.15. This caused the build error "undefined reference to `lzo1_info`".

To fix the issue, we changed the function name to `lzo1_info_1_15` in the line `size_t ret = lzo1_info_1_15(&rbits, &clevel);`. This ensures that the code uses the correct function for the LZO library version 1.15.

After making this change, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
