Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "lzo/lzoconf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "lzo/lzo1x.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int rbits = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int clevel = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t ret = lzo1_info_1_15(&rbits, &clevel);  // Fix the function name
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an issue with the function name `lzo1_info`. The correct function name for the LZO library version 1.15 is `lzo1_info_1_15`. This is because the LZO library has multiple versions, and the function names may vary between versions.

To fix the code, we need to change the function name to `lzo1_info_1_15`. This will ensure that the code uses the correct function for the LZO library version 1.15.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
