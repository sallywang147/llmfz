Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/AprImpl.h"
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/AprImpl.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t sample_index = provider.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::shared_ptr<Alembic::Abc::OObject> sample;
  Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::AprImpl::getSample(nullptr, sample_index, &sample);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include <Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/AprImpl.h>` directive. This is necessary because the header file contains C++ code that needs to be compiled as C code in order to be compatible with the C-style interface of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The fixed code includes the header file with the `extern "C" {}` wrapper, which ensures that the C++ code in the header file is compiled as C code. This allows the code to be linked successfully and the build error to be resolved.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
