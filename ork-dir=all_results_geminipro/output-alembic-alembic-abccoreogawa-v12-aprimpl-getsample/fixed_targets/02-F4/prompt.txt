Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/AprImpl.h"
#include "Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/OgawaIndex.h"
#include "Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa/v12/OgawaUtil.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::AprImpl apr;
  size_t index = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::shared_ptr<Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::OgawaIndex> ogawa_index =
      std::make_shared<Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::OgawaIndex>();
  std::shared_ptr<void> sample;
  apr.getSample(ogawa_index->get(), index, &sample);  // Corrected the function call
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `getSample` function was called incorrectly. The correct syntax is `apr.getSample(ogawa_index->get(), index, &sample)`. The `get` function is used to retrieve the underlying `OgawaIndex` object from the `std::shared_ptr`.

The corrected code uses the correct syntax for the `getSample` function call, which should resolve the build error and allow the program to compile and run as intended.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
