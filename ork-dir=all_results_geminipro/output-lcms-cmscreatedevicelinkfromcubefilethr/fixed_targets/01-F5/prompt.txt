Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "lcms2.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
#include <lcms2_plugin.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 12) {
    return 0;
  }

  cmsContext ContextID = cmsCreateContext(NULL, NULL);
  char *cFileName = (char *)data;

  cmsCreateDeviceLinkFromCubeFileTHR(ContextID, cFileName);

  cmsDeleteContext(ContextID);
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the following changes:

1. The header file `lcms2.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function declarations in `lcms2.h` are exported with C linkage, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

2. The function `cmsCreateDeviceLinkFromCubeFileTHR` is declared in the header file `lcms2_plugin.h`. This ensures that the function is available to the compiler when compiling the code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
