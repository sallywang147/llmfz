The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `printf'
```

This error occurs because the `printf` function is not defined in the current scope. To fix this, we need to include the `stdio.h` header, which defines the `printf` function. However, since we are using C++ in this program, we need to use the `extern "C"` directive to tell the compiler that the `printf` function is defined in a C library.

The corrected code includes the `stdio.h` header wrapped with the `extern "C"` directive, which fixes the build error.
