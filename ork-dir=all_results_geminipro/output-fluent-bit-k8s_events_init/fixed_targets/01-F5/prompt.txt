Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "k8s_events.h"
}

// Declare the missing functions in the header file k8s_events.h
int k8s_events_init(struct flb_input_instance* ins, struct flb_config* config, char* config_data);
void k8s_events_finish(struct flb_input_instance* ins);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct flb_input_instance ins;
  struct flb_config config;

  const std::string config_string = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* config_data = const_cast<char*>(config_string.c_str());

  int ret = k8s_events_init(&ins, &config, config_data);
  if (ret == 0) {
    k8s_events_finish(&ins);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the missing function declarations for `k8s_events_init` and `k8s_events_finish` in the `k8s_events.h` header file. These declarations are necessary for the compiler to recognize the functions when they are called in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
