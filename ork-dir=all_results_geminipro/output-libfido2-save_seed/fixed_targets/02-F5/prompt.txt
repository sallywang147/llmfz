Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string opt = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  save_seed(opt.c_str());
  return 0;
}

void save_seed(const char* seed) {
  // Save the seed to a file or database for later analysis.
  printf("Seed: %s\n", seed);
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `save_seed` function is declared and defined.
- The `stdio.h` header is included within the `extern "C" {}` block.
- The `printf` function is used to print the seed to the console.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
