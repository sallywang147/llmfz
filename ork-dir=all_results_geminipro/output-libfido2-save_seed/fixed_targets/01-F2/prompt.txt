Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string opt = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  save_seed(const_cast<char*>(opt.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `save_seed` function is not declared in the code.
2. The `stdlib.h` header is not included, which is necessary for the `save_seed` function.

To fix the code, we need to:

1. Add the declaration of the `save_seed` function.
2. Include the `stdlib.h` header.
3. Wrap the `#include <stdlib.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is exported with C linkage.

The corrected code is given above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
