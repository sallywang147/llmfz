Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "private_settings.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Create a private_settings_t struct.
  struct private_settings_t *this_ptr = new struct private_settings_t;
  memset(this_ptr, 0, sizeof(struct private_settings_t));

  // Generate random values for the struct members.
  this_ptr->settings = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024)).c_str();
  this_ptr->merge = provider.ConsumeBool();
  this_ptr->key = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024)).c_str();

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  bool result = load_string_section(this_ptr, this_ptr->settings, this_ptr->merge, this_ptr->key);

  // Clean up the allocated memory.
  delete this_ptr;

  return 0;
}
```
The issue was that the `load_string_section` function was not declared in the code. To fix this, the `extern "C"` directive was added to the `#include "private_settings.h"` line, which wraps the header file in a C-style linkage specification. This allows the C++ compiler to find the `load_string_section` function, which is likely declared in a C header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
