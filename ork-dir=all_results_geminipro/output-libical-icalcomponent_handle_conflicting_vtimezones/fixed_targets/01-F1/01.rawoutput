The original code had several issues:

1. The `libical` library was not properly linked to the program, resulting in the linker error `undefined reference to 'icalcomponent_new_from_string'`. To fix this, the `libical` library needs to be linked to the program during compilation. This can be done by adding the `-lical` flag to the compiler command.

2. The `icalcomponent_new` function was not properly declared, resulting in the compiler error `'icalcomponent_new' was not declared in this scope`. To fix this, the `icalcomponent_new` function needs to be declared before it is used. This can be done by including the `libical/ical.h` header file, which contains the declaration for the `icalcomponent_new` function.

3. The `icalcomponent_add_property` function was not properly declared, resulting in the compiler error `'icalcomponent_add_property' was not declared in this scope`. To fix this, the `icalcomponent_add_property` function needs to be declared before it is used. This can be done by including the `libical/ical.h` header file, which contains the declaration for the `icalcomponent_add_property` function.

4. The `icalcomponent_handle_conflicting_vtimezones` function was not properly declared, resulting in the compiler error `'icalcomponent_handle_conflicting_vtimezones' was not declared in this scope`. To fix this, the `icalcomponent_handle_conflicting_vtimezones` function needs to be declared before it is used. This can be done by including the `libical/ical.h` header file, which contains the declaration for the `icalcomponent_handle_conflicting_vtimezones` function.

5. The `icalcomponent_free` function was not properly declared, resulting in the compiler error `'icalcomponent_free' was not declared in this scope`. To fix this, the `icalcomponent_free` function needs to be declared before it is used. This can be done by including the `libical/ical.h` header file, which contains the declaration for the `icalcomponent_free` function.

After fixing these issues, the program should compile and run successfully.
