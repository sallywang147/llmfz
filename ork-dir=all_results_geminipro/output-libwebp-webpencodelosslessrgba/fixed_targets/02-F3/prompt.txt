Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <webp/encode.h>
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t width = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t height = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t bits_per_sample = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::vector<uint8_t> input_data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>();

  char* output_data = nullptr;
  size_t output_size = WebPEncodeLosslessRGBA(
      reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(input_data.data()), width, height, bits_per_sample,
      &output_data);
  free(output_data);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that the input data is passed to `WebPEncodeLosslessRGBA` as a `char*`, but the function expects a `const uint8_t*`. This can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.

To fix this, the input data is casted to `const uint8_t*` before passing it to the function. This ensures that the data is passed in the correct format and that the function can process it correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
