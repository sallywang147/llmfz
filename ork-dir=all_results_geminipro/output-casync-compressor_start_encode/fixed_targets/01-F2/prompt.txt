Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzz.h>
#include <compressor.h>
#include <log.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  _cleanup_(compressor_finish) CompressorContext c = COMPRESSOR_CONTEXT_INIT;

  if (size < 1)
    return 0;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int compressor = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 100);

  int r = compressor_start_encode(&c, compressor);
  if (r < 0) {
    log_debug_errno(r, "compressor_start_encode failed: %m");
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}

LIBFUZZER_DEFINE_FUZZER(LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput);
```

The build error is caused by the missing `LIBFUZZER_DEFINE_FUZZER` macro. This macro is necessary to define the entry point for the fuzzer.

To fix the issue, add the following line at the end of the code:

```c++
LIBFUZZER_DEFINE_FUZZER(LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput);
```

This macro will define the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function as the entry point for the fuzzer.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
