Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include <wgnutls/wgnutls.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  char* buf = new char[bufsize];
  const int argsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  char* arg = new char[argsize];
  const double timeout = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();

  wgnutls_peek(fd, buf, bufsize, arg, timeout);

  delete[] buf;
  delete[] arg;
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary header file `<wgnutls/wgnutls.h>` for the `wgnutls_peek` function. The `extern "C"` block is not needed in this case because the `wgnutls` library is already written in C and does not require C++ name mangling.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
