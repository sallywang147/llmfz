The original code had a few issues:

1. The `wgnutls_peek` function takes six arguments, but the code only passed five. The sixth argument is the size of the `arg` buffer, which needs to be passed in order for the function to work correctly.
2. The `wgnutls_peek` function expects the `arg` buffer to be a null-terminated string. The code did not ensure that the `arg` buffer was null-terminated, which could lead to undefined behavior.

The fixed code addresses these issues by passing the correct number of arguments to `wgnutls_peek` and ensuring that the `arg` buffer is null-terminated.
