Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "skcms.h"

extern "C" {
#include "skcms_priv.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  union skcms_Curve curve;
  struct skcms_TransferFunction inv_tf;
  skcms_Curve_init(&curve);
  skcms_TransferFunction_init(&inv_tf);

  const size_t curve_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 256);
  const uint8_t* curve_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(curve_size);
  skcms_Curve_setData(&curve, curve_data, curve_size);

  const size_t inv_tf_size =
      stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 256);
  const uint8_t* inv_tf_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(inv_tf_size);
  skcms_TransferFunction_setData(&inv_tf, inv_tf_data, inv_tf_size);

  const bool result = skcms_AreApproximateInverses(&curve, &inv_tf);

  skcms_Curve_destroy(&curve);
  skcms_TransferFunction_destroy(&inv_tf);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error was:
```
error: undefined reference to 'skcms_AreApproximateInverses'
```

This error means that the linker could not find the definition of the function `skcms_AreApproximateInverses`.
The function is declared in the header file `skcms_priv.h`, but this header file is not included in the code.
To fix the error, we need to include the header file `skcms_priv.h` in the code.
We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the header file is written in C and not in C++.

The fixed code includes the header file `skcms_priv.h` and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`.
This should fix the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
