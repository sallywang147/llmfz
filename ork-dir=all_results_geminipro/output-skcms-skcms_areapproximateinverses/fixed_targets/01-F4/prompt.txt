Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "skcms.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t curve_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  union skcms_Curve curve;
  curve.bytes = new uint8_t[curve_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(curve.bytes, curve_size);

  const size_t inv_tf_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  struct skcms_TransferFunction inv_tf;
  inv_tf.bytes = new uint8_t[inv_tf_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(inv_tf.bytes, inv_tf_size);

  bool are_approximate_inverses = skcms_AreApproximateInverses(&curve, &inv_tf);

  delete[] curve.bytes;
  delete[] inv_tf.bytes;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `skcms_AreApproximateInverses` function is declared as `bool skcms_AreApproximateInverses(const skcms_Curve*, const skcms_TransferFunction*)`, but it is called with `skcms_AreApproximateInverses(&curve, &inv_tf)`, which is incorrect. The correct way to call the function is `skcms_AreApproximateInverses(&curve, &inv_tf)`.

2. The `curve` and `inv_tf` variables are declared as `union skcms_Curve` and `struct skcms_TransferFunction`, but they are initialized with `new uint8_t[curve_size]` and `new uint8_t[inv_tf_size]`, respectively. This is incorrect because `skcms_Curve` and `skcms_TransferFunction` are structures, not arrays. The correct way to initialize these variables is to use the `skcms_Curve` and `skcms_TransferFunction` constructors.

The corrected code fixes these issues by calling the `skcms_AreApproximateInverses` function correctly and initializing the `curve` and `inv_tf` variables correctly.

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
