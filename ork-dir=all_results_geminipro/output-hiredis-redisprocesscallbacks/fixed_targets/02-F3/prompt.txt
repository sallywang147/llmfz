Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <hiredis/async.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct redisAsyncContext *ac = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
  if (ac == NULL || ac->err) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Set a timeout of 1 second for the connection.
  struct timeval timeout = {1, 0};
  redisAsyncSetConnectTimeout(ac, &timeout);

  // Send a command to the server.
  redisAsyncCommand(ac, NULL, NULL, "SET key %b", data, size);

  // Process the command and wait for a response.
  redisAsyncHandleConnect(ac);
  redisAsyncHandleRead(ac);

  // Free the context.
  redisAsyncFree(ac);

  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the following changes were made:

1. Added `#include <sys/time.h>` to include the necessary header for using `struct timeval`.
2. Added `redisAsyncSetConnectTimeout(ac, &timeout);` to set a timeout of 1 second for the connection.
3. Changed `redisProcessCallbacks(ac);` to `redisAsyncHandleConnect(ac);` and `redisAsyncHandleRead(ac);` to properly handle the connection and read the response.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
