Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "redisAsync.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  redisAsyncContext *c = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
  if (c->err) {
    return 0;
  }
  redisProcessCallbacks(c);
  redisAsyncDisconnect(c);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:
- Missing the `redisAsync.h` header file, which is needed for the `redisAsyncConnect`, `redisProcessCallbacks`, and `redisAsyncDisconnect` functions.
- The `redisAsync.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The fixed code includes the `redisAsync.h` header file and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the necessary functions are available and that the object linking will succeed.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
