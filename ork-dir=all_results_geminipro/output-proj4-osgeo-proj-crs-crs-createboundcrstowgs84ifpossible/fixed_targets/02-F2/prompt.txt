Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"
#include "proj/crs.h"

extern "C" {
#include "proj/crs.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  osgeo::proj::crs::CRS crs;
  crs.fromWKT(str);
  std::shared_ptr<osgeo::proj::crs::CRS> bound_crs;
  crs.createBoundCRSToWGS84IfPossible(nullptr, bound_crs.get(), nullptr, 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing header file `proj/crs.h` in the `extern "C" {}` block. The `proj/crs.h` header file contains the declaration of the `osgeo::proj::crs::CRS` class and other related functions and classes.

To fix the build error, we need to include the `proj/crs.h` header file within the `extern "C" {}` block. This will ensure that the C compiler can find the declaration of the `osgeo::proj::crs::CRS` class and other related functions and classes.

The corrected code is shown above. The `proj/crs.h` header file is now included within the `extern "C" {}` block, and the build error should be resolved.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
