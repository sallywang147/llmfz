Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "mkcldrn.h"
#include "mkcldrn_gcd.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  uint32_t n = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  uint32_t m = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  uint32_t k = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  uint32_t l = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  uint32_t p = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  uint32_t q = provider.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();

  struct problem_rdft p_rdft;
  p_rdft.n = n;
  p_rdft.m = m;
  p_rdft.k = k;
  p_rdft.l = l;
  p_rdft.p = p;
  p_rdft.q = q;

  struct planner_s plnr;
  struct P_s ego;

  int ret = mkcldrn_gcd(&p_rdft, &plnr, &ego);
  if (ret == 0) {
    printf("mkcldrn_gcd returned 0\n");
  } else {
    printf("mkcldrn_gcd returned %d\n", ret);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mkcldrn.h` and `mkcldrn_gcd.h` headers are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the functions in these headers are written in C, and the C++ compiler needs to know that they are C functions.

2. The `mkcldrn_gcd` function is declared as `int mkcldrn_gcd(...)`, but the definition in `mkcldrn_gcd.h` is `int32_t mkcldrn_gcd(...)`. This is a mismatch between the declaration and the definition, and the compiler will generate an error.

To fix these issues, we need to wrap the `mkcldrn.h` and `mkcldrn_gcd.h` headers with `extern "C" {}`, and we need to change the declaration of `mkcldrn_gcd` to match the definition in `mkcldrn_gcd.h`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
