Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include "../src/nokogiri_gumbo.h"

extern "C" {
#include <caret_diagnostic.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 10) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct GumboInternalError error;
  struct GumboStringBuffer output;
  gumbo_string_buffer_init(&output);

  caret_diagnostic_to_string(&error, (const char *)data, size, &output);
  gumbo_string_buffer_destroy(&output);

  return 0;
}
```
In the fixed code, the type of `data` has been changed from `char *` to `const char *` to match the signature of `caret_diagnostic_to_string`. This ensures that the function is called correctly and avoids undefined behavior.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
