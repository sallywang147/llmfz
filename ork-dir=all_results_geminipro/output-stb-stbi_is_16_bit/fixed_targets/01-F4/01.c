The issue in the original code was that the `stbi_is_16_bit` function is declared in the `stb_image.h` header file, which is a C header file. When compiling the C++ program, the compiler expects the function to be declared with `extern "C"`, which indicates that the function is defined in a C file.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for the `stb_image.h` header file should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C declarations and that the functions declared in the header file should be treated as C functions.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for the `stb_image.h` header file is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This should allow the program to compile successfully.
