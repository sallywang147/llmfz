Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4)
    return 0;
  char filename[256];
  snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "/tmp/stb_image_fuzzer_XXXXXX");
  int fd = mkstemp(filename);
  if (fd == -1)
    return 0;
  write(fd, data, size);
  close(fd);

  int result = stbi_is_16_bit(filename);

  unlink(filename);

  return result;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The issue in the original code was that the `stbi_is_16_bit` function is declared in the `stb_image.h` header file, which is a C header file. When compiling the C++ program, the compiler expects the function to be declared with `extern "C"`, which indicates that the function is defined in a C file.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for the `stb_image.h` header file should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C declarations and that the functions declared in the header file should be treated as C functions.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for the `stb_image.h` header file is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This should allow the program to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
