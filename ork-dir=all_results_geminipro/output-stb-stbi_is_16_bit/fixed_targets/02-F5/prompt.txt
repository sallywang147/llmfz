Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = stbi_is_16_bit(filename.c_str());

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The original code has an error because the `stbi_is_16_bit` function is declared in the C header file `stb_image.h`, which uses the C calling convention. However, the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared in C++ and uses the C++ calling convention. This mismatch in calling conventions causes the linker to generate an undefined reference error.

To fix this error, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `stb_image.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to use the C calling convention for all functions and variables declared in that header file.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = stbi_is_16_bit(filename.c_str());

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
