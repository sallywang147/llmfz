The issue with the original code was that the `avahi_get_host_name` function expects a double pointer to a character array as its first argument, but the code was passing a single pointer. This caused the build error.

To fix the issue, the code was changed to pass a double pointer to `avahi_get_host_name`. This can be done by using the `&` operator to take the address of the `ret_s` pointer.

The corrected code:
```c++
ret_s = avahi_get_host_name(&ret_s, size);
