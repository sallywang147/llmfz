Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "avahi-common/defs.h"
#include "avahi-common/malloc.h"
#include "avahi-core/log.h"

extern "C" {
#include "avahi-client/client.h"
#include "avahi-client/lookup.h"
#include "avahi-client/publish.h"
#include "avahi-client/resolve.h"
}

void log_function(AvahiLogLevel level, const char *txt) {}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char **ret_s = NULL;

  avahi_set_log_function(log_function);

  if (size > AVAHI_MAX_HOST_NAME_LENGTH)
    return 0;

  ret_s = avahi_get_host_name(&ret_s, size);
  if (!ret_s)
    return 0;

  avahi_free(*ret_s);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `avahi_get_host_name` function expects a double pointer to a character array as its first argument, but the code was passing a single pointer. This caused the build error.

To fix the issue, the code was changed to pass a double pointer to `avahi_get_host_name`. This can be done by using the `&` operator to take the address of the `ret_s` pointer.

The corrected code:
```c++
ret_s = avahi_get_host_name(&ret_s, size);
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
