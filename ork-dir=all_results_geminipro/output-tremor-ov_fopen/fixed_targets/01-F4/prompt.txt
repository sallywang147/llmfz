Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ivorbisfile.h"
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  OggVorbis_File vf;
  char *path = new char[Size + 1];
  memcpy(path, Data, Size);
  path[Size] = '\0';  // Add null-terminator to make it a valid C string
  int result = ov_fopen(path, &vf);
  if (result < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  ov_clear(&vf);
  delete[] path;
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'ov_fopen'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ov_fopen`. This is because the header file `ivorbisfile.h` does not contain the definition of this function. To fix this, we need to include the header file that contains the definition of `ov_fopen`.

The header file that contains the definition of `ov_fopen` is `vorbisfile.h`. We can include this header file by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "vorbisfile.h"
```

After adding this line, the linker will be able to find the definition of `ov_fopen` and the error will be fixed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
