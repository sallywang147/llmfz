Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ivorbisfile.h"
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  OggVorbis_File vf;
  char *path = new char[Size + 1];
  memcpy(path, Data, Size);
  path[Size] = '\0';
  int result = ov_fopen(path, &vf);
  if (result < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  ov_clear(&vf);
  delete[] path;
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'ov_fopen'
```

This error is caused by the missing declaration of the `ov_fopen` function. To fix it, we need to include the necessary header file that contains the declaration of this function. In this case, the header file is `ivorbisfile.h`.

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the `ivorbisfile.h` header file contains C declarations, and we are compiling the code as C++.

Additionally, we need to add a null-terminator to the `path` buffer to make it a valid C string.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
