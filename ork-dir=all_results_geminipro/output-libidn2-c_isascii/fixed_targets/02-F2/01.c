The build error is likely caused by the use of the `c_isascii` function, which is declared in the `<cctype>` header. However, the `<cctype>` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for C++ to link to C functions.

To fix the issue, wrap the `<cctype>` header with `extern "C" {}`:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <cctype>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  c_isascii(c);
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should build successfully.
