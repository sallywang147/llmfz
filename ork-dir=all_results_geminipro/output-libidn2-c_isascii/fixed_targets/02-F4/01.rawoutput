```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <cctype>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  return c_isascii(c);
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the return value of `c_isascii` was not being used. This has been fixed in the provided code.
