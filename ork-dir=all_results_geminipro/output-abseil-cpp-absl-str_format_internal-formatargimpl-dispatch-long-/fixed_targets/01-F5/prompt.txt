Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include "absl/strings/str_format.h"

extern "C" {
#include "absl/strings/str_format_internal.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);
  long long_value = fuzzed_data.ConsumeIntegral<long>();  // Fix: Added 'long' data type
  std::string spec = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  int out = fuzzed_data.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 10000);

  char buf[1024];
  bool result = absl::str_format_internal::FormatArgImpl::Dispatch<long>(
      reinterpret_cast<char *>(&long_value), spec.c_str(), out, buf);
  if (!result) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added the missing `long` data type to the `ConsumeIntegral` function call.
2. Changed the `long_value` variable declaration to `long long_value`.

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `ConsumeIntegral` function was missing the `long` data type, which caused the build error.
2. The `long_value` variable was declared as `int`, which was incorrect because the `ConsumeIntegral` function returns a `long` value.

The fixed code addresses these issues and should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
