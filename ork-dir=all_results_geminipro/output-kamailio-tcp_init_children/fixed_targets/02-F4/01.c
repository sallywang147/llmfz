The fixed code includes the `stdlib.h` header using the `extern "C"` block. This tells the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++. This is necessary because the `stdlib.h` header is a C header, and it uses the C calling convention. If we did not use the `extern "C"` block, the compiler would try to use the C++ calling convention, which would result in a linker error.
