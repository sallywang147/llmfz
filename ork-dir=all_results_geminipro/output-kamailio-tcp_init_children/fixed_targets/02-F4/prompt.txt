Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <tcp.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int woneinit = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  tcp_init_children(&woneinit);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the issue is that the `stdlib.h` header is not included in the code. This header is necessary for the `rand()` function to be used in `tcp_init_children`. To fix the issue, we need to include the `stdlib.h` header using the `extern "C"` block.

The `extern "C"` block is used to tell the compiler that the following code is written in C, not C++. This is necessary because the `stdlib.h` header is a C header, and it uses the C calling convention. If we did not use the `extern "C"` block, the compiler would try to use the C++ calling convention, which would result in a linker error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
