Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janet/vm.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetEVGenericMessage args;
  JanetEVGenericMessage ret;
  args.data = (uint8_t *)data;
  args.size = size;
  janet_go_thread_subr(&args, &ret);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following build issues:

1. The header `<janet/vm.h>` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions declared in the header.

To fix this, we need to wrap the header with `extern "C" {}` as follows:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include <janet/vm.h>
}
```

2. The function `janet_go_thread_subr` is not declared in the header `<janet.h>`. This causes the compiler to complain about an undeclared identifier.

To fix this, we need to include the header `<janet/go.h>` which declares the function `janet_go_thread_subr`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
