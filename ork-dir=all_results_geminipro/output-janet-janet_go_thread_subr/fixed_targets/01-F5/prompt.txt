Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janet/vm.h>
#include <janet/go.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetEVGenericMessage args;
  JanetEVGenericMessage ret;
  args.data = (uint8_t *)data;
  args.size = size;
  janet_go_thread_subr(&args, &ret);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `janet_init()` and `janet_deinit()` functions are not declared in the `janet.h` header file.
2. The `janet_go_thread_subr()` function is not declared in the `janet/go.h` header file.

To fix these issues, the `janet.h` and `janet/go.h` header files need to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` function is written in C++, and it needs to be able to call the Janet functions, which are written in C.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
