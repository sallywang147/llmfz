Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code is correct and does not contain any errors. Therefore, there is no need to fix it.

The build error message is not provided, so it is not possible to determine the exact cause of the build failure.

If you encounter a build error, you can try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that all the necessary header files are included.
2. Check that the function definitions match the function declarations.
3. Ensure that the libraries required by the program are linked correctly.
4. Verify that the compiler and linker settings are correct.

If you are still unable to resolve the build error, you can provide the error message and the complete code, and I will try to help you identify the issue.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `tinyxml2::XMLText* tinyxml2::XMLElement::InsertNewText(const char* text)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `tinyxml2::XMLText* tinyxml2::XMLElement::InsertNewText(const char* text)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
