The provided code is correct and does not contain any errors. Therefore, there is no need to fix it.

The build error message is not provided, so it is not possible to determine the exact cause of the build failure.

If you encounter a build error, you can try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that all the necessary header files are included.
2. Check that the function definitions match the function declarations.
3. Ensure that the libraries required by the program are linked correctly.
4. Verify that the compiler and linker settings are correct.

If you are still unable to resolve the build error, you can provide the error message and the complete code, and I will try to help you identify the issue.
