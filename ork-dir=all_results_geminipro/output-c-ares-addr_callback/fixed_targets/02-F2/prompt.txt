Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" void addr_callback(char *, int, int, char *, int);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  char *name = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  int type = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int class_ = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  char *addr = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  int ttl = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  addr_callback(name, type, class_, addr, ttl);

  free(name);
  free(addr);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `addr_callback` is declared as `extern "C"`, but it is not defined in the code. This results in a linker error.
2. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared as `extern "C"`, but it is not defined in the code. This results in a linker error.

To fix the code, we need to define the function `addr_callback` and `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. We can do this by adding the following code to the end of the file:

```c++
void addr_callback(char *name, int type, int class_, char *addr, int ttl) {
  // Do something with the arguments.
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // Do something with the data.
  return 0;
}
```

Now, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
