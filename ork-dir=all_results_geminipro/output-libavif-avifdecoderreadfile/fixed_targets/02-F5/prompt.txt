Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstring>
#include "avif/avif.h"
#include "avif/avif_cxx.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  avif::DecoderPtr decoder(avifDecoderCreate());
  if (decoder == nullptr)
    return 0;
  decoder->allowProgressive = AVIF_TRUE;

  // ClusterFuzz passes -rss_limit_mb=2560 to avif_decode_fuzzer. Empirically
  // setting decoder->imageSizeLimit to this value allows avif_decode_fuzzer to
  // consume no more than 2560 MB of memory. Also limit the dimensions to avoid
  // timeouts and to speed the fuzzing up.
  constexpr uint32_t kImageSizeLimit = 8 * 1024 * 8 * 1024;
  static_assert(kImageSizeLimit <= AVIF_DEFAULT_IMAGE_SIZE_LIMIT, "");
  decoder->imageSizeLimit = kImageSizeLimit;

  avifIO *const io = avifIOCreateMemoryReader(Data, Size);
  if (io == nullptr)
    return 0;
  // Simulate Chrome's avifIO object, which is not persistent.
  io->persistent = AVIF_FALSE;
  avifDecoderSetIO(decoder.get(), io);

  avifImage img = {};
  int result = avifDecoderReadFile(decoder.get(), &img);
  avifImageDestroy(&img);

  // Release allocated memory.
  avifDecoderDestroy(decoder.get());
  avifIOFree(io);

  return result;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:
1. The `avifImage` struct is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif.h` header.
2. The `avifDecoderCreate()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif_cxx.h` header.
3. The `avifIOCreateMemoryReader()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif.h` header.
4. The `avifDecoderSetIO()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif_cxx.h` header.
5. The `avifDecoderReadFile()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif_cxx.h` header.
6. The `avifImageDestroy()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif.h` header.
7. The `avifDecoderDestroy()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif_cxx.h` header.
8. The `avifIOFree()` function is missing. This can be fixed by including the `avif/avif.h` header.

The fixed code includes all of the necessary headers and functions, and it should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
