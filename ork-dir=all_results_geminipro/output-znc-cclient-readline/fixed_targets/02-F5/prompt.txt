Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::string input = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(size);
  CClient client;
  client.PutLine(input);  // Fix: Use the correct function PutLine instead of ReadLine
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `#include <znc/Client.h>` directive was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to complain about an undefined reference to `CClient`.
2. The `client.ReadLine()` function was used instead of `client.PutLine()`. This would have caused the client to read a line of input from the user, instead of sending a line of input to the server.

The fixed code wraps the `#include <znc/Client.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` and uses the correct `client.PutLine()` function. This should allow the code to compile and run correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
