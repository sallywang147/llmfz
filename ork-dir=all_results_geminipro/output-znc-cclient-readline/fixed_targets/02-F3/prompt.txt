Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::string input = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(size);
  CClient client;
  client.PutLine(input);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has two issues:

1. The function `ReadLine` is not a member function of `CClient`. The correct function is `PutLine`.
2. The header `znc/Client.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header is written in C++ and the fuzzer is written in C.

The fixed code uses the correct function `PutLine` and wraps the header `znc/Client.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
