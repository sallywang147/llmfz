Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  znc::CSocket socket;
  znc::CClient client(&socket);
  client.ReadLine(input);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `znc` library is not included correctly. It should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ symbols are exported in a way that is compatible with the C code in `libFuzzer`.

2. The `znc::CSocket` and `znc::CClient` classes are not declared as `extern "C"`, which means that their constructors and methods are not exported in a way that is compatible with the C code in `libFuzzer`.

To fix these issues, we need to wrap the `#include <znc/Client.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` and declare the `znc::CSocket` and `znc::CClient` classes as `extern "C"`.

The corrected code:

```c++
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  znc::CSocket socket;
  znc::CClient client(&socket);
  client.ReadLine(input);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and link successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
