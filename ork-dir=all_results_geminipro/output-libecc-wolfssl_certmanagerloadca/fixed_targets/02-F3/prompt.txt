Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "wolfssl/options.h"
#include "wolfssl/ssl.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha256.h"
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha512.h"
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha384.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  WOLFSSL_CERT_MANAGER* cert_manager = wolfSSL_CertManagerNew();
  if (cert_manager == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const std::string cert_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string key_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  wolfSSL_CertManagerLoadCA(cert_manager, const_cast<char*>(cert_file.c_str()),
                           const_cast<char*>(key_file.c_str()));
  wolfSSL_CertManagerFree(cert_manager);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by missing header files for SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. To fix the issue, the following header files are included:

```c++
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha256.h"
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha512.h"
#include "wolfssl/wolfcrypt/sha384.h"
```

These header files are wrapped in `extern "C" {}` to ensure that they are compatible with the C++ compiler.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
