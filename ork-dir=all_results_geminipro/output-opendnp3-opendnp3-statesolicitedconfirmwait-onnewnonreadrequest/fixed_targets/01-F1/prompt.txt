Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <opendnp3/master/StateSolicitedConfirmWait.h>
#include <opendnp3/master/MasterApplication.h>

#include <dnp3mocks/MockMasterApplication.h>
#include <dnp3mocks/MockOContext.h>
#include <dnp3mocks/MockParsedRequest.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  opendnp3::StateSolicitedConfirmWait state;

  std::shared_ptr<opendnp3::MockOContext> ocontext = std::make_shared<opendnp3::MockOContext>();
  std::shared_ptr<opendnp3::MockMasterApplication> application = std::make_shared<opendnp3::MockMasterApplication>();
  std::shared_ptr<opendnp3::MockParsedRequest> request = std::make_shared<opendnp3::MockParsedRequest>();

  std::bad_array_new_length arr;
  state.OnNewNonReadRequest(&arr, ocontext.get(), request.get());

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
