Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str, *cmd;
  struct redisContext *c = redisConnect("localhost", 6379);

  if (c == NULL || c->err) {
    return 0;
  }

  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  new_str = malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap, new_str);
  if (redisvCommand(c, new_str, &ap) != -1)
    hi_free(cmd);  // Use `hi_free` to free the `cmd` string.
  va_end(ap);

  free(new_str);
  redisFree(c);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. `hi_free` was used instead of `free` to free the `cmd` string. This is because `hi_free` is the correct function to use for freeing strings allocated by the hiredis library.
2. The `extern "C" {}` block was added around the `#include <stdio.h>` directive. This is necessary to ensure that the C standard library functions are properly linked with the program.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
