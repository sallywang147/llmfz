Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pjsip.h>
#include <pjlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <pjsip_ua.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct pjsip_module tsx_user;
  struct pjsip_rx_data rdata;
  struct pj_grp_lock_t grp_lock;
  struct pjsip_transaction *p_tsx;
  pjsip_tsx_create_uas2(&tsx_user, &rdata, &grp_lock, &p_tsx);
  pjsip_tsx_free(p_tsx);
  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the function `pjsip_tsx_free` is used to free the memory allocated for the transaction `p_tsx`, but the function is not declared in the header files included in the code. To fix this, the declaration of `pjsip_tsx_free` needs to be included in the code.

The corrected code includes the declaration of `pjsip_tsx_free` by wrapping the `#include <pjsip_ua.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function declaration is visible to the compiler and linker, and the code can be built successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
