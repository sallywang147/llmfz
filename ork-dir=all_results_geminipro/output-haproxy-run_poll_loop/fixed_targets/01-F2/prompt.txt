Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <poll.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  // Initialize the fuzzer.
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Read the input data.
  std::vector<uint8_t> input_data = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>();

  // Call the function under test.
  run_poll_loop(input_data.data(), input_data.size());

  // Return 0 to indicate success.
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the following changes were made:

- Included the necessary header `<poll.h>` for the `poll()` function.
- Wrapped the `#include <poll.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure compatibility with C++ compilers.
- Modified the `run_poll_loop()` function to accept a pointer to the input data and its size as arguments.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
