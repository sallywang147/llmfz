Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include <yaml.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string data_str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string buffer_str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const size_t size_read = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  char* data_ptr = const_cast<char*>(data_str.c_str());
  char* buffer_ptr = const_cast<char*>(buffer_str.c_str());

  int result = yaml_file_read_handler(data_ptr, buffer_ptr, size_read,
                                     const_cast<size_t*>(&size_read));
  return result;
}
```
In this case, the error is:
```
error: undefined reference to `yaml_file_read_handler'
```
This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `yaml_file_read_handler`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library that contains this function is linked with our program.

In this case, the library that contains `yaml_file_read_handler` is `libyaml`. To link with this library, we need to add the following line to our build command:
```
-lyaml
```
For example, if we are using GCC, we would add the following line to our build command:
```
g++ -lyaml ...
```
Once we have added the necessary library, we should be able to build our program without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
