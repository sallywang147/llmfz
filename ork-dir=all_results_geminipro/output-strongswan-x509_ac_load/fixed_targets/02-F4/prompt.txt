Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <openssl/x509.h>

extern "C" {
#include <openssl/x509_ac.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  int type = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, size));
  const unsigned char *data_ptr = bytes.data();

  struct x509_ac_t *x509_ac = x509_ac_load(type, data_ptr);
  if (x509_ac != NULL) {
    x509_ac_free(x509_ac);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
