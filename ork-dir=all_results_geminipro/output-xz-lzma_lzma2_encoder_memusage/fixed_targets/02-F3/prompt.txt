Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "lzma.h"

extern "C" {
#include "lzma.h"
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t options_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  std::vector<char> options(options_size);
  provider.ConsumeBytes(options.data(), options_size);
  size_t memusage = lzma_lzma2_encoder_memusage(options.data(), options_size);
  return memusage;
}
```

In this case, the issue was that the `lzma_lzma2_encoder_memusage` function takes two arguments, but only one was being passed. The correct prototype for the function is:

```c
size_t lzma_lzma2_encoder_memusage(const lzma_options_lzma2* options, size_t opt_size);
```

To fix the issue, the second argument, `options_size`, was added to the call to `lzma_lzma2_encoder_memusage`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
