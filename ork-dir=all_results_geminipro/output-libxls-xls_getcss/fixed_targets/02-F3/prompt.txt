Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_buffer(Data, Size, NULL, NULL);
  if (work_book) {
    char *css = xls_getCSS(work_book);
    free(css);
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'xls_open_buffer'
error: undefined reference to 'xls_getCSS'
error: undefined reference to 'xls_close_WB'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of the functions `xls_open_buffer`, `xls_getCSS`, and `xls_close_WB`.

To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file `xls.h` is included in the compilation of the program. We can do this by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "xls.h"
```

This will include the header file and make the definitions of the functions available to the linker.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_buffer(Data, Size, NULL, NULL);
  if (work_book) {
    char *css = xls_getCSS(work_book);
    free(css);
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
