Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "AbcCoreOgawa/v12/ReadArraySample.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  auto i_dims = std::make_shared<std::vector<size_t>>();
  auto i_data = std::make_shared<std::vector<uint8_t>>();
  auto data_type = std::make_shared<Alembic::AbcCoreAbstract::v12::DataType>(
      Alembic::AbcCoreAbstract::v12::DataType::kUnknown);
  auto i_child_bounds = std::make_shared<std::vector<Alembic::AbcCoreAbstract::v12::ArraySample>>();
  Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::ReadArraySample(i_dims, i_data, 0, data_type, i_child_bounds);
  return 0;
}
```

The only issue in the code is that the `#include "AbcCoreOgawa/v12/ReadArraySample.h"` line is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the build error `undefined reference to Alembic::AbcCoreOgawa::v12::ReadArraySample`.

To fix the issue, wrap the `#include "AbcCoreOgawa/v12/ReadArraySample.h"` line with `extern "C" {}`. The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
