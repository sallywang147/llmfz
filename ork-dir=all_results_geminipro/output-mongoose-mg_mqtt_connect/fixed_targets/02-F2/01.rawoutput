```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_mgr mgr;
  mg_mqtt_opts opts;
  mg_mqtt_opts_init(&opts);
  struct mg_connection *c = mg_mqtt_connect(&mgr, url.c_str(), &opts, nullptr, nullptr);
  mg_mqtt_opts_free(&opts);
  mg_mgr_free(&mgr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

- `mg_mqtt_connect` is not declared in this scope.
- `mg_mqtt_opts_init` and `mg_mqtt_opts_free` are not declared in this scope.
- `mg_mgr_free` is not declared in this scope.

To fix these issues, we need to include the necessary header files. In this case, we need to include `mongoose.h`. We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names.

The corrected code is shown above.
