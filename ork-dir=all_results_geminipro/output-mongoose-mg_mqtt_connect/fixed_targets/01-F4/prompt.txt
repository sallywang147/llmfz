Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct mg_mgr mgr;
  mg_mgr_init(&mgr);
  struct mg_mqtt_opts opts;
  mg_mqtt_opts_init(&opts);
  struct mg_connection * c = mg_mqtt_connect(&mgr, url.c_str(), &opts, nullptr,
                                            nullptr);
  if (c == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  mg_mqtt_disconnect(c);
  mg_mgr_free(&mgr);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'mg_mqtt_connect'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the `mg_mqtt_connect` function. This is because the `mongoose.h` header file does not contain a definition for this function. To fix this error, you need to include the header file that contains the definition of the `mg_mqtt_connect` function.

In this case, the `mg_mqtt_connect` function is defined in the `mongoose.c` file. So, you need to include the `mongoose.c` file in your program. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your program:

```
#include "mongoose.c"
```

After adding this line, the linker will be able to find the definition of the `mg_mqtt_connect` function and the build error will be fixed.

Here is the complete fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
#include "mongoose.c"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct mg_mgr mgr;
  mg_mgr_init(&mgr);
  struct mg_mqtt_opts opts;
  mg_mqtt_opts_init(&opts);
  struct mg_connection * c = mg_mqtt_connect(&mgr, url.c_str(), &opts, nullptr,
                                            nullptr);
  if (c == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  mg_mqtt_disconnect(c);
  mg_mgr_free(&mgr);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
