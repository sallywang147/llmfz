Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "jbig2.h"

extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

// Define the function jbig2_default_realloc
void* jbig2_default_realloc(void* allocator, void* ptr, size_t size) {
  return std::realloc(ptr, size);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t initial_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024 * 1024);
  char* p = static_cast<char*>(std::malloc(initial_size));
  const size_t new_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024 * 1024);
  Jbig2Allocator allocator = {};
  allocator.realloc = jbig2_default_realloc;
  char* result = allocator.realloc(&allocator, p, new_size);
  std::free(p);
  std::free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code defines the function `jbig2_default_realloc` and includes the necessary header files.

The original code had the following issues:

1. The header `#include "jbig2.h"` was included twice, which is not necessary and can cause compilation errors.
2. The function `jbig2_default_realloc` was not defined in the code.

To fix the code, we can remove the duplicate `#include "jbig2.h"` and define the function `jbig2_default_realloc`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
