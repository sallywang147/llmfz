Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "sbr_enc.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "FDK_assert.h"
#include "FDK_tools.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  SBR_ENCODER *hSbrEncoder = sbrEncoder_Open(48000, 1);
  assert(hSbrEncoder != NULL);

  int samplesBufSize = 1024;
  short *samples = (short *)malloc(samplesBufSize * sizeof(short));
  assert(samples != NULL);

  int sbrDataBits = 0;
  bool sbrData = 0;

  sbrEncoder_EncodeFrame(hSbrEncoder, samples, samplesBufSize, &sbrDataBits, &sbrData);

  sbrEncoder_Close(hSbrEncoder);
  free(samples);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `FDK_ASSERT` macro was replaced with `assert`.
- The `FDK_tools.h` header file was included within the `extern "C" {}` block.
- The `sbrEncoder_Open` function was called with the correct number of arguments.
- The `samplesBufSize` variable was initialized to a reasonable value.
- The `samples` array was allocated using `malloc` instead of `new`.
- The `sbrDataBits` and `sbrData` variables were initialized to 0.
- The `sbrEncoder_EncodeFrame` function was called with the correct arguments.
- The `sbrEncoder_Close` function was called to close the SBR encoder.
- The `free` function was used to free the `samples` array.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
