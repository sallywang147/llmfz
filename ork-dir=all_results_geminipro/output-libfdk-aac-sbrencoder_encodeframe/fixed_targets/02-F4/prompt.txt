Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "sbr_enc.h"
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  HANDLE_SBRENCODER hSbrEncoder = NULL;
  INT16 *samples = NULL;
  INT32 samplesBufSize = 0;
  INT32 *sbrDataBits = NULL;
  INT8* sbrData = NULL; // Change the declaration of sbrData to INT8*

  hSbrEncoder = sbrEncoder_Open();
  FDK_ASSERT(hSbrEncoder != NULL);

  const uint8_t *start = Data;
  UINT valid, buffer_size;

  do {
    valid = buffer_size = Data + Size - start;
    samplesBufSize = valid / 2;
    samples = (INT16 *)start;
    start += buffer_size - valid;
    sbrEncoder_EncodeFrame(hSbrEncoder, samples, samplesBufSize, &sbrDataBits, &sbrData); // Pass the address of sbrData
  } while (valid > 0);

  sbrEncoder_Close(hSbrEncoder);
  hSbrEncoder = NULL;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a single issue:
* The declaration of `sbrData` was incorrect. It should have been `INT8*` instead of `INT32*`. This has been fixed in the corrected code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
