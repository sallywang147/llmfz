```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `FDK_ASSERT` macro was replaced with `assert`.
- The `FDK_tools.h` header file was included within the `extern "C" {}` block.
- The `sbrEncoder_Open` function was called with the correct number of arguments.
- The `samplesBufSize` variable was initialized to a reasonable value.
- The `samples` array was allocated using `malloc` instead of `new`.
- The `sbrDataBits` and `sbrData` variables were initialized to 0.
- The `sbrEncoder_EncodeFrame` function was called with the correct arguments.
- The `sbrEncoder_Close` function was called to close the SBR encoder.
- The `free` function was used to free the `samples` array.
