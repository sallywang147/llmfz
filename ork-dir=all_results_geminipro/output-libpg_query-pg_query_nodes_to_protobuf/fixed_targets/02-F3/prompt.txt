Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `pg_query_nodes_to_protobuf'
```

This means that the function `pg_query_nodes_to_protobuf` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function.

The header file that defines `pg_query_nodes_to_protobuf` is `libpq-fe.h`. However, this header file is already included in the code, so the error message is confusing.

One possible explanation for the error message is that the `libpq-fe.h` header file is not being included correctly. To fix this, we can wrap the `#include` directive for `libpq-fe.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the compiler to look for the `pg_query_nodes_to_protobuf` function in the C library, rather than the C++ library.

The corrected code is:

```
#include <pg_query.h>

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libpq-fe.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  pg_query_nodes_to_protobuf(new_str);

  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
