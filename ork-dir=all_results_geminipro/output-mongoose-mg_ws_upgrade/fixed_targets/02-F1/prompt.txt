Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "mongoose.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct mg_connection connection;
  memset(&connection, 0, sizeof(connection));

  struct mg_http_message http_message;
  memset(&http_message, 0, sizeof(http_message));

  const size_t fmt_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<char> fmt_buffer(fmt_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(fmt_buffer.data(), fmt_size);

  mg_ws_upgrade(&connection, &http_message, fmt_buffer.data());
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
