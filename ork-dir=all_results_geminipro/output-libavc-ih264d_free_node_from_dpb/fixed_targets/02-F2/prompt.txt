Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "ih264d_dpb.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const struct dpb_manager_t* ps_dpb_mgr =
      reinterpret_cast<const struct dpb_manager_t*>(stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>());
  const int u4_cur_pic_num = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const char u1_numRef_frames_for_seq = stream.ConsumeIntegral<char>();
  ih264d_free_node_from_dpb(ps_dpb_mgr, u4_cur_pic_num, u1_numRef_frames_for_seq);
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed `const_cast` from the call to `ih264d_free_node_from_dpb`. This is because the function takes a non-const pointer to a `dpb_manager_t` struct, and we don't need to modify the struct itself.

2. Added the `extern "C"` linkage specifier to the declaration of `ih264d_free_node_from_dpb`. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C library, and we are calling it from a C++ program. Without the `extern "C"` specifier, the linker would not be able to find the function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
