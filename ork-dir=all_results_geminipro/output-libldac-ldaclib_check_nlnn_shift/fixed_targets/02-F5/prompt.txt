Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "ldaclib.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int smplrate_id = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>() % 4;
  const int nlnn_shift = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>() % 15;
  ldaclib_check_nlnn_shift(smplrate_id, nlnn_shift);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added `% 4` and `% 15` to the `ConsumeIntegral` calls to ensure that the values are within the valid range.
2. Wrapped the `#include "ldaclib.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is visible to the linker.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
