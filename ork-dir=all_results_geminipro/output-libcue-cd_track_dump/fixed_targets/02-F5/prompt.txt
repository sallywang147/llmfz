Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libcue.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libavformat/avformat.h>
#include <libavutil/avutil.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Track *track = cd_track_new();
  if (!track) {
    return 0;
  }
  cd_track_parse(track, data, size);
  cd_track_dump(track);
  cd_track_free(track);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
