Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "libcue.h"
#include "cd_track_dump.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Track *track = cd_track_new_from_data(data, size);
  if (track == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  cd_track_dump(track);
  cd_track_free(track);
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code is shown above.

1. We wrapped the `#include` directive for `libcue.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to use C-style linkage for the symbols declared in `libcue.h`.

2. We added a declaration for `cd_track_new_from_data` to the header file `cd_track_dump.h`. This tells the compiler where to find the definition of the function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
