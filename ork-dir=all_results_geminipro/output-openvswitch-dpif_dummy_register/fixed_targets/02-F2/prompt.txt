Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <dpif/dpif.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int level = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  dpif_dummy_register(level);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue here is that the `dpif/dpif.h` header file is not included in the code. This header file is necessary for the `dpif_dummy_register` function to be used. To fix this, we need to include the `dpif/dpif.h` header file in the code.

We also need to wrap the `#include <dpif/dpif.h>` line with `extern "C" {}` because the `dpif/dpif.h` header file contains C code, and we are compiling the code with a C++ compiler. The `extern "C" {}` block tells the compiler to compile the code inside the block as C code, rather than C++ code.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
