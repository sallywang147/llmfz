Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

#include "Firestore/core/src/core/query.h"
#include "Firestore/core/src/model/document_comparator.h"

extern "C" {
#include "Firestore/core/src/api/fuzzer/fuzzed_data_provider.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  firebase::firestore::model::DocumentComparator comparator;
  firebase::firestore::core::Query query;
  query.SetComparator(&comparator);  // Corrected the function name

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `SetComparator` function was being called with an incorrect argument. The `SetComparator` function takes a pointer to a `DocumentComparator` object as its argument, but the original code was passing the `DocumentComparator` object itself. This resulted in the build error.

The corrected code fixes this issue by passing the address of the `DocumentComparator` object to the `SetComparator` function. This allows the function to properly set the comparator for the query.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
