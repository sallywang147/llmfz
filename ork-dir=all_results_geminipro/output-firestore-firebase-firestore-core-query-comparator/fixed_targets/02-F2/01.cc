```

The issue in the original code was that the `SetComparator` function was being called with an incorrect argument. The `SetComparator` function takes a pointer to a `DocumentComparator` object as its argument, but the original code was passing the `DocumentComparator` object itself. This resulted in the build error.

The corrected code fixes this issue by passing the address of the `DocumentComparator` object to the `SetComparator` function. This allows the function to properly set the comparator for the query.
