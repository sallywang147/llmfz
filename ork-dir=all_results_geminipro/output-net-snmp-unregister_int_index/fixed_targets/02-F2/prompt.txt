Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <libunwind.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<uint8_t> name_bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(name_len);
  size_t* name = reinterpret_cast<size_t*>(name_bytes.data());
  int val = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  unregister_int_index(name, name_len, val);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code is missing the necessary header file `libunwind.h` for the function `unregister_int_index`. To fix the issue, we need to include this header file. Since `unregister_int_index` is a C function, we need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure proper linking.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`, which resolves the build issue.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
