Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <inttypes.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::vector<uint8_t> name_bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(name_len);
  const int val = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t* name = reinterpret_cast<size_t*>(name_bytes.data());

  unregister_int_index(name, name_len, val);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `unregister_int_index` is not defined.
2. The header `<inttypes.h>` is missing.

To fix the first issue, we need to include the header file that defines the function `unregister_int_index`. Since the function is not part of the standard C++ library, we need to check the documentation of the library that provides this function and include the corresponding header file.

To fix the second issue, we need to include the header `<inttypes.h>` which defines the `PRIu64` macro used in the `unregister_int_index` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
