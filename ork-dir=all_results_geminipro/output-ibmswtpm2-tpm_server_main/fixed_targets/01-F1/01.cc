The original code has the following issues:

1. The `TpmBuildSwitches.h` and `TpmTcpProtocol.h` headers are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to not be able to find the definitions of the functions declared in these headers, resulting in the `undefined reference` errors.

To fix this, we wrap the `#include` directives for these headers with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the declarations in these headers as C declarations, which allows the linker to find them.

2. The `tpm_server_main` function is not declared as `extern "C"`, which causes the linker to not be able to find its definition.

To fix this, we add the `extern "C"` declaration to the `tpm_server_main` function. This tells the compiler to treat the function as a C function, which allows the linker to find it.
