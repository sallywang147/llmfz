The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `argc` variable was changed from 1 to 2 to account for the additional command-line argument `-i`.
2. The `argv` array was changed to include the `-i` argument, which tells `tpm_server_main` to read input from a file.
3. The `tmpfile_name` variable was changed from `NULL` to a valid temporary file name.
4. The `tmpfile` variable was changed from `NULL` to a valid file pointer.
5. The `fwrite` call was changed to write the input data to the temporary file.
6. The `freopen` call was changed to redirect stdin to the temporary file.
7. The `tpm_server_main` function was called with the correct number of arguments.
8. The `remove` call was changed to remove the temporary file.

These changes should fix the build issues and allow the code to run as intended.
