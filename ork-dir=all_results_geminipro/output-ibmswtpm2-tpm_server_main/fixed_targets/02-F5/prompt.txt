Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "TpmTcpProtocol.h"
#ifdef TPM_WINDOWS
extern "C" {
#include "TcpServer_fp.h"
}
#endif
#ifdef TPM_POSIX
extern "C" {
#include "TcpServerPosix_fp.h"
}
#endif

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int argc = 2;
  char *argv[] = { "tpm_server", "-i" };

  if (Data == NULL || Size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Create a temporary file to store the input data.
  char tmpfile_name[] = "/tmp/tpm_server_XXXXXX";
  int fd = mkstemp(tmpfile_name);
  if (fd == -1) {
    perror("mkstemp");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  FILE *tmpfile = fdopen(fd, "wb");
  if (tmpfile == NULL) {
    perror("fdopen");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  if (fwrite(Data, Size, 1, tmpfile) != 1) {
    perror("fwrite");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  fclose(tmpfile);

  // Redirect stdin to the temporary file.
  if (freopen(tmpfile_name, "rb", stdin) == NULL) {
    perror("freopen");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  // Call tpm_server_main with the temporary file as input.
  int ret = tpm_server_main(argc, argv);

  // Remove the temporary file.
  if (remove(tmpfile_name) != 0) {
    perror("remove");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  return ret;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `tmpfile_name` variable was changed to use a valid temporary file name template.
2. The `mkstemp()` function was used to create a temporary file.
3. The `fdopen()` function was used to open the temporary file as a stream.
4. The `freopen()` function was changed to redirect stdin to the temporary file.

These changes should fix the build issues and allow the code to run as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
