Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "TpmTcpProtocol.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int argc = 3;
  char *argv[] = {
      "tpm_server_main",
      "-h",
      "127.0.0.1",
  };

  if (size > 0) {
    argv[2] = (char *)data;
  }

  return tpm_server_main(argc, argv);
}

extern "C" int tpm_server_main(int argc, char *argv[]);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  return LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput((const uint8_t *)argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));
}
```

In this corrected code:

- Added a `main` function to serve as the entry point for the program.

- Inside the `main` function, we call `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` with the first command-line argument as input. This allows the program to be used as a standalone fuzzer.

- Changed the return type of `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to `int` to match the expected return type for a fuzzer function.

With these changes, the program can be built and run as a standalone fuzzer, taking input from the command line and passing it to the `tpm_server_main` function for processing.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
