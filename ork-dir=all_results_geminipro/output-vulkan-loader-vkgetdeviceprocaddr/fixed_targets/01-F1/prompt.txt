Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Extract an array of bytes as a vector. You MUST call .data() to use result as pointer.
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  char *ptr = reinterpret_cast<char *>(bytes.data());

  // Extract an array of bytes as a vector. You MUST call .data() to use result as pointer.
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes2 = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  char *ptr2 = reinterpret_cast<char *>(bytes2.data());

  vkGetDeviceProcAddr((VkDevice_T *)ptr, ptr2);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
