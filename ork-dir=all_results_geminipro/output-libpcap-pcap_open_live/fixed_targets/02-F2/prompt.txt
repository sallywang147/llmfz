Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Generate random values for function arguments
  std::string device = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);
  int snaplen = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1024);
  int promisc = stream.ConsumeBool() ? 1 : 0;
  int to_ms = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 1000);
  std::string errbuf = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);

  // Call the function with the generated arguments
  struct pcap *pcap_handle = pcap_open_live(device.c_str(), snaplen, promisc, to_ms, errbuf.c_str());

  // Close the PCAP handle if it was successfully opened
  if (pcap_handle != nullptr) {
    pcap_close(pcap_handle);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <pcap/pcap.h>` directive to ensure that the C library functions are properly linked. This is necessary because the `pcap` library is a C library, and the fuzzer is a C++ program.

- Changed the `pcap_open_live()` function call to use `device.c_str()` and `errbuf.c_str()` instead of `device` and `errbuf`. This is necessary because the `pcap_open_live()` function expects C-style strings, and `device` and `errbuf` are C++ strings.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
