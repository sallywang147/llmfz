The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'pcap_open_live'
```

This error is caused by the fact that the `pcap_open_live` function is declared in the `pcap.h` header file, but it is not defined in the program. To fix this, we need to link the program with the `libpcap` library, which contains the definition of the `pcap_open_live` function.

To do this, we can add the following line to the top of the program:

```
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
```

This will include the `pcap.h` header file, which will declare the `pcap_open_live` function. We also need to add the following line to the bottom of the program:

```
extern "C" {
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
}
```

This will wrap the `pcap.h` header file in an `extern "C"` block, which will tell the compiler that the functions declared in the header file are written in C, not C++. This is necessary because the `pcap_open_live` function is written in C, and the program is written in C++.

With these changes, the program should now compile and run successfully.
