Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "op_post.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct IndexSharedData* shared_data = new struct IndexSharedData;
  struct IndexPrivateData* private_data = new struct IndexPrivateData;
  int arg_2 = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int arg_3 = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int ret = op_post(shared_data, private_data, arg_2, arg_3);
  delete shared_data;
  delete private_data;
  return ret;
}
```

The build error was:

```
error: undefined reference to 'op_post'
```

This error means that the linker could not find the definition of the function `op_post`. The function is declared in the header file `op_post.h`, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are being linked.

To fix this error, you need to add the definition of the function `op_post` to one of the source files. You can do this by creating a new source file that contains the definition of the function, or by adding the definition of the function to an existing source file.

Once you have added the definition of the function `op_post` to a source file, you need to recompile the program. This will create a new object file that contains the definition of the function, and the linker will be able to find it when it is linking the program.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
