The build error was:

```
error: undefined reference to 'op_post'
```

This error means that the linker could not find the definition of the function `op_post`. The function is declared in the header file `op_post.h`, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are being linked.

To fix this error, you need to add the definition of the function `op_post` to one of the source files. You can do this by creating a new source file that contains the definition of the function, or by adding the definition of the function to an existing source file.

Once you have added the definition of the function `op_post` to a source file, you need to recompile the program. This will create a new object file that contains the definition of the function, and the linker will be able to find it when it is linking the program.
