Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "freetype/freetype.h"

#include "freetype/lzwfuzztarget.h"

extern "C" {
#include "freetype/lzw.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string text = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  freetype::LzwFuzzTarget target(text);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `freetype/lzw.h` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `lzw_decode()` function, which is declared in that header.

To fix the issue, the `#include "freetype/lzw.h"` line was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header should be treated as a C header, even though it is being included in a C++ file. This allows the linker to find the definition of the `lzw_decode()` function.

With this change, the code should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
