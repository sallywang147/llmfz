Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "freetype/lzw.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  freetype::LzwFuzzTarget target(input.data(), input.size());
  target.LzwFuzzTarget(&target);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the definition of the `freetype::LzwFuzzTarget` class. This is because the header file `freetype/lzw.h` is not properly included in the C++ code. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `freetype/lzw.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header file contains C code, which is necessary for the compiler to properly link the C++ code with the C code in the header file.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for `freetype/lzw.h` is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which should fix the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
