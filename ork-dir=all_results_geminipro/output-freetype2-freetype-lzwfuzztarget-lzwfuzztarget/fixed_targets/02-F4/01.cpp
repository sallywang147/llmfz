The issue with the original code was that the `freetype/lzw.h` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `lzw_decode()` function, which is declared in that header.

To fix the issue, the `#include "freetype/lzw.h"` line was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the header should be treated as a C header, even though it is being included in a C++ file. This allows the linker to find the definition of the `lzw_decode()` function.

With this change, the code should now compile and run correctly.
