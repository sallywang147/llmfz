Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <mntent.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct libmnt_table *table = mnt_new_table_from_file(
      const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str()));
  mnt_free_table(table);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `mnt_new_table_from_file'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `mnt_new_table_from_file`. This function is declared in the header file `<mntent.h>`, but the linker needs to know where the actual definition of the function is located.

To fix this error, you need to add the library that contains the definition of `mnt_new_table_from_file` to the linker command line. This library is usually called `libmnt`.

You can do this by adding the following line to your build command:

```
-l:libmnt
```

This will tell the linker to look for the definition of `mnt_new_table_from_file` in the library `libmnt`.

Once you have done this, the error should go away and the program should build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
