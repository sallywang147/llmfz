Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <mntent.h>

extern "C" {
#include <mntent.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct libmnt_table *table = mnt_new_table_from_file(
      const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str()));
  mnt_free_table(table);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The header file `<mntent.h>` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C function declarations, and the C++ compiler needs to know that these declarations are in C, not C++.
* The function `mnt_new_table_from_file` was declared as `extern "C"`. This is also necessary because the function is declared in a C header file.

With these changes, the code should now build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
