Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <mntent.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mnt_new_table_from_file(const_cast<char*>(file_name.c_str()));
  mnt_free_table();  // Free the allocated memory before returning
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added `#include <mntent.h>` inside the `extern "C" {}` block to include the necessary header file for the `mntent.h` functions.

2. Added a call to `mnt_free_table()` before returning from the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. This ensures that the memory allocated by `mnt_new_table_from_file()` is properly freed, preventing memory leaks.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
