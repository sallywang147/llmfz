Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "opentype-sanitiser.h"
#include "ots.h"

namespace ots {

bool OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn::ParsePart(OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn *this, Buffer *table) {
  uint16_t setting_count;
  if (!table->ReadU16(&setting_count)) {
    return OTS_FAILURE();
  }
  this->setting_count = setting_count;
  this->settings = new uint16_t[setting_count];
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < setting_count; ++i) {
    if (!table->ReadU16(&this->settings[i])) {
      return OTS_FAILURE();
    }
  }
  return true;
}

}  // namespace ots

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ots::Buffer table(data, size);
  ots::OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn setting_defn;
  ots::OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn::ParsePart(&setting_defn, &table);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:
1. The `ots` namespace is not declared in the global scope, which causes the build error "undefined reference to `ots::Buffer::Buffer`".
2. The `ots::OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn::ParsePart` function is not declared as `extern "C"`, which causes the build error "undefined reference to `ots::OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn::ParsePart`".

To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Declare the `ots` namespace in the global scope.
2. Add `extern "C"` before the declaration of the `ots::OpenTypeFEAT::FeatureSettingDefn::ParsePart` function.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
