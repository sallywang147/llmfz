Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "roaring/roaring.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<uint32_t> values;
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    values.push_back(stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>());
  }

  roaring_bitmap_t* bitmap = roaring_bitmap_create();
  for (uint32_t value : values) {
    roaring_bitmap_add(bitmap, value);  // Fix: use roaring_bitmap_add instead of roaring_bitmap_add_offset
  }
  roaring_bitmap_free(bitmap);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that it uses `roaring_bitmap_add_offset` to add values to the bitmap, which is incorrect for the intended purpose. The correct function to use is `roaring_bitmap_add`, which adds a single value to the bitmap.

The corrected code uses `roaring_bitmap_add` to add values to the bitmap, which is the correct function for this purpose.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
