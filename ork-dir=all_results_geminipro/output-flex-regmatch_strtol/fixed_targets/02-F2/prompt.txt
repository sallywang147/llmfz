Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <regex.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Create a regmatch_t struct.
  struct regmatch_t m;
  m.rm_so = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  m.rm_eo = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  // Generate a random string.
  std::string str = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  char* src = str.c_str();

  // Generate a random end pointer.
  char* endptr = src + stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, str.size());

  // Generate a random base.
  int base = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(2, 37);

  // Call the function.
  regmatch_strtol(&m, src, &endptr, base);

  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is caused by the missing header file `regex.h`. To fix it, we need to include this header file within an `extern "C" {}` block. This is because `regmatch_strtol` is a C function, and we need to use the C calling convention to call it from C++.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file and wraps the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the `regmatch_strtol` function is properly declared and can be called from C++.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
