Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "gd.h"
#include "gdfontg.h"
#include "gdfontl.h"
#include "gdfontmb.h"
#include "gdfonts.h"
#include "gdfontt.h"

extern "C" {
#include "gd_gif_in.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string bytes = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  FILE *fp = fmemopen(reinterpret_cast<void *>(const_cast<char *>(bytes.c_str())),
                       bytes.size(), "r");
  gdImagePtr img = gdImageCreateFromGif(fp);
  if (img == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  gdImageDestroy(img);
  fclose(fp);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `gdImageCreateFromGif` function is declared in the `gd_gif_in.h` header, which is not included in the code.
2. The `gdImageCreateFromGif` function is not declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, which is necessary for it to be visible to the C++ code.

To fix these issues, the `gd_gif_in.h` header is included in the code, and the `gdImageCreateFromGif` function is declared with the `extern "C"` linkage.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
