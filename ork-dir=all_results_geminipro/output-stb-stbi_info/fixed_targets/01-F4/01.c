```

The changes made are:

1. Changed `stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &channels, 4)` to `stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &channels, 0)`. This change is necessary because the `stbi_load()` function expects the number of channels to be specified as the fourth argument, and in this case, we want to load the image without any alpha channel.

2. Added `remove(filename);` after `free(img);` to remove the temporary file that was created to store the image data. This is good practice to avoid leaving temporary files on the system.
