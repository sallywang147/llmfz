Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code has the following build issues:

1. The header file `mpeg2dec.h` is not included.
2. The function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_one` is not declared.

To fix the issues, we need to:

1. Include the header file `mpeg2dec.h`.
2. Declare the function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_one`.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "mpeg2dec.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _stream_t stream_struct;
  memset(&stream_struct, 0, sizeof(stream_struct));

  stream_struct.p_next_byte = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(size).data();
  stream_struct.size_remaining = size;

  short sym_len, sym_val;
  impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_one(&stream_struct, &sym_len, &sym_val);
  return 0;
}

int impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_one(struct _stream_t* stream, short* sym_len, short* sym_val);
```

The function `impeg2d_dec_ac_coeff_one` is declared at the end of the code. This is necessary because the function is defined in a different compilation unit.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
