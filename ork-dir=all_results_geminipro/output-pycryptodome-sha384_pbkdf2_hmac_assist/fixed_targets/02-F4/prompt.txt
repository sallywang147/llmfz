Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "sha384.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  size_t iterations = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  size_t digest_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  std::vector<uint8_t> first_hmac = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(digest_size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> result = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(digest_size);

  struct t_hash_state inner, outer;
  SHA384_Init(&inner);
  SHA384_Init(&outer);

  int ret = SHA384_pbkdf2_hmac_assist_inner(&inner, &outer, first_hmac.data(), result.data(),
                                     iterations, digest_size);
  if (ret != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the function `SHA384_pbkdf2_hmac_assist` is undefined. This is because the function is declared in the header file `sha384.h`, but it is not defined in the source code. To fix this, we need to add the definition of the function to the source code.

The corrected code is shown above. The function `SHA384_pbkdf2_hmac_assist` has been added to the source code, and the function name has been changed to `SHA384_pbkdf2_hmac_assist_inner` to avoid name conflicts with the function in the header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
