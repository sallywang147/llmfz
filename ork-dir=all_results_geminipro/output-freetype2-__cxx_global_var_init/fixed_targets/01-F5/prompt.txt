Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code is missing the necessary header files and function declarations. To fix the build error, you need to include the following header files and declare the missing functions:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size);
}

int main() {
  // Initialize the fuzzer
  FuzzedDataProvider dataProvider(0);

  // Generate a random input
  std::string input = dataProvider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(1024);

  // Process the input
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. Included the necessary header files:
   - `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>`: This header file provides the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, which is used to generate random inputs for fuzzing.
   - `<stdlib.h>`: This header file provides the `exit()` function, which is used to terminate the program.
   - `<iostream>`: This header file provides the `std::cout` object, which is used for printing output.

2. Declared the missing functions:
   - `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`: This function is the entry point for the fuzzer. It takes a pointer to a buffer containing the input data and the size of the input data as arguments. The function should process the input data and return 0 if it succeeds or a non-zero value if it fails.

3. Added a `main()` function:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. It initializes the fuzzer, generates a random input, processes the input, and then terminates the program.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void __cxx_global_var_init()` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void __cxx_global_var_init()` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
