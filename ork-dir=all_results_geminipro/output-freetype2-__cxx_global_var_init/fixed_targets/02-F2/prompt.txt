Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following issues:

1. The `stdlib.h` header is missing. This header is necessary for the `exit()` function to be used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
2. The `void __cxx_global_var_init();` line is not necessary and can be removed.

The fixed code includes the `stdlib.h` header and removes the unnecessary line. The `extern "C" {}` block is added to wrap the `#include <stdlib.h>` directive, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
