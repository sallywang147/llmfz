Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  return 0;
}
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `__cxx_global_var_init()` function is not declared.
2. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is not declared.

To fix these issues, we can remove the `__cxx_global_var_init()` function call and declare the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
