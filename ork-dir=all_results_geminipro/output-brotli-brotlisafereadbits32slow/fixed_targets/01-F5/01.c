// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  const uint8_t *next_in = data;
  size_t avail_in = size;
  BrotliBitReader br;
  BrotliBitReaderInit(&br, next_in, avail_in);
  uint32_t val;
  BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow(&br, 32, &val);  // Fix: Use uint32_t pointer
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the code is that the `BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow` function takes a pointer to a `uint32_t` as its third argument, but the code was passing a `uint32_t` value instead. This caused a compiler error because the function signature did not match the function call.

To fix the issue, the code was changed to pass a pointer to the `val` variable instead of the variable itself. This ensures that the function is called with the correct arguments and the compiler error is resolved.
