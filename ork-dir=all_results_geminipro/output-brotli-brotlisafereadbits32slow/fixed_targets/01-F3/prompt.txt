Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <brotli/decode.h>

// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  const uint8_t *next_in = data;
  size_t avail_in = size;
  BrotliBitReader br;
  BrotliBitReaderInit(&br, next_in, avail_in);
  uint32_t val;
  BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow(&br, 32, &val);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

- The `BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow` function expects a `uint32_t` pointer as the third argument, but the code passes a `size_t` pointer.
- The `BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow` function is declared in the `brotli/decode.h` header, which needs to be included with `extern "C"` to ensure that the function is exported with C linkage.

The fixed code uses `uint32_t` for the third argument of `BrotliSafeReadBits32Slow` and includes the `brotli/decode.h` header with `extern "C"`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
