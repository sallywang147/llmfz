Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "butteraugli/butteraugli.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::vector<uint8_t> input(data, data + size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> output;
  butteraugli::Image img;
  double score;
  bool status = butteraugli::ButteraugliInterface(&input, &output, &img, &score);
  return status ? 0 : 1;  // Return 0 if the status is true, 1 otherwise.
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `butteraugli::ButteraugliInterface` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but the `butteraugli` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the function is not visible to the linker.

To fix this, the `#include "butteraugli/butteraugli.h"` line should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The `std::vector` class is not declared as `extern "C"`, which causes a linker error because the class is not visible to the linker.

To fix this, the `#include <vector>` line should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
