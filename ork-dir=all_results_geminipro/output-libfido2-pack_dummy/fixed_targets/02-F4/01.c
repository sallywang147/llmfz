#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "pack_dummy.h"
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char* ptr = new char[len];
  size_t ret = pack_dummy(ptr, len);
  delete[] ptr;
  return ret;
}
```

The corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "pack_dummy.h"
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  char* ptr = new char[len];
  size_t ret = pack_dummy(ptr, len);
  delete[] ptr;
  return ret;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
error: undefined reference to `pack_dummy'
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
The issue is that the function `pack_dummy` is not defined in the code. To fix this, you need to include the definition of `pack_dummy` in your code.

One way to do this is to add the following line to the top of your code:

```c++
#include "pack_dummy.c"
```

This will include the definition of `pack_dummy` from the file `pack_dummy.c`.

Another way to fix this issue is to create a static library that contains the definition of `pack_dummy` and then link your code against that library.

Here are the steps to create a static library:

1. Create a new file called `pack_dummy.c` and add the following code to it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

size_t pack_dummy(char* ptr, size_t len) {
  // Do something with the data in ptr
  return len;
}
```

2. Compile the file `pack_dummy.c` into an object file:

```
gcc -c pack_dummy.c
```

3. Create a static library from the object file:

```
ar rcs libpack_dummy.a pack_dummy.o
```

4. Add the following line to the top of your code:

```c++
#include "libpack_dummy.a"
```

This will link your code against the static library `libpack_dummy.a`.

After making these changes, you should be able to compile and run your code without errors.
