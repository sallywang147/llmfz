The issues in the original code are:

1. The `#include` directive for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause build errors related to undefined references to the `FuzzedDataProvider` class.

2. The `pack_dummy` function is not defined. This can cause build errors related to undefined references to the `pack_dummy` function.

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `#include` directive for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures compatibility with the C++ compiler and resolves the build errors related to undefined references to the `FuzzedDataProvider` class.

2. The `pack_dummy` function is defined. This resolves the build errors related to undefined references to the `pack_dummy` function.

With these changes, the code should build successfully.
