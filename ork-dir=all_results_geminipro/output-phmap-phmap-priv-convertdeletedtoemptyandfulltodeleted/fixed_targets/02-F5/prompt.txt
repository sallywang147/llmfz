Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <phmap/phmap.h>

using namespace phmap::priv;

extern "C" {
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);
  const size_t capacity = fuzzed_data.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 10000);
  char *ctrl = new char[capacity];
  memset(ctrl, 'd', capacity);
  ConvertDeletedToEmptyAndFullToDeleted(ctrl, capacity);
  delete[] ctrl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, `memset` is used to initialize the `ctrl` array with 'd' characters. This ensures that all elements in the array are initialized, which is necessary for the `ConvertDeletedToEmptyAndFullToDeleted` function to work correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
