Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "h2o.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct st_h2o_mem_pool_t* pool = h2o_mem_pool_create();
  if (pool == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  int quality = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  size_t window = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  size_t block = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  struct st_h2o_compress_context_t* ctx =
      h2o_compress_brotli_open(pool, quality, window, block);
  if (ctx == nullptr) {
    h2o_mem_pool_release(pool);
    return 0;
  }
  h2o_compress_brotli_close(ctx);
  h2o_mem_pool_release(pool);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `h2o.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for C++ to link with C code.
2. The `h2o_compress_brotli_open` and `h2o_compress_brotli_close` functions are not declared as `extern "C"`, which is also necessary for C++ to link with C code.

The fixed code wraps the `h2o.h` header with `extern "C" {}` and declares the `h2o_compress_brotli_open` and `h2o_compress_brotli_close` functions as `extern "C"`. This allows the C++ code to link with the C code correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
