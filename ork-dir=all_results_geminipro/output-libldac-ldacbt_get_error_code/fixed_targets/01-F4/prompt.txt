Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "ldacBT.h"
}

// Declare the ldacBT_get_error_code() function in the ldacBT.h header file.
int ldacBT_get_error_code(struct _st_ldacbt_handle *hLdacBT);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _st_ldacbt_handle *hLdacBT = ldacBT_get_handle();

  // Check if the handle is NULL before using it.
  if (hLdacBT == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  ldacBT_get_error_code(hLdacBT);
  ldacBT_close_handle(hLdacBT);
  ldacBT_free_handle(hLdacBT);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `ldacBT_get_error_code()` function was declared in the `ldacBT.h` header file.
- A check was added to see if the handle is `NULL` before using it.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
