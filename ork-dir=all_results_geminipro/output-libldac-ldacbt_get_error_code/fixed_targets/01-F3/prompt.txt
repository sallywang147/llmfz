Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "ldacBT.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _st_ldacbt_handle *hLdacBT = ldacBT_get_handle();
  if (hLdacBT == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  ldacBT_get_error_code(hLdacBT);
  ldacBT_close_handle(hLdacBT);
  ldacBT_free_handle(hLdacBT);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

- The `ldacBT_get_handle()` function may return `NULL` if it fails to allocate memory for the handle. This can lead to a crash when trying to access the handle's members. To fix this, we added a check to see if the handle is `NULL` before using it.
- The `ldacBT_get_error_code()` function is not declared in the `ldacBT.h` header file. This can lead to a linker error when trying to build the program. To fix this, we added a declaration for the function in the `ldacBT.h` header file.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
