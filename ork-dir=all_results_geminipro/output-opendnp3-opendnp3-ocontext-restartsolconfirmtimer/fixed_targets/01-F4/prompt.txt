Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <opendnp3/outstation/OContext.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  opendnp3::OContext context;
  context.RestartSolConfirmTimer();  // Remove the nullptr argument
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build error because the `RestartSolConfirmTimer` method of the `opendnp3::OContext` class takes no arguments, but the code was calling it with a `nullptr` argument. To fix this, the `nullptr` argument was removed from the call to `RestartSolConfirmTimer`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
