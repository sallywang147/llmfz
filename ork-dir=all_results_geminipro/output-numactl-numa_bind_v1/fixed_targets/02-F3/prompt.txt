Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "numa.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <string.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct nodemask_t *mask = NULL;

  char *fuzz_str1 = malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(fuzz_str1, data, size);
  fuzz_str1[size] = '\0';

  mask = numa_parse_nodestring(fuzz_str1);
  if (mask != NULL) {
    numa_bind_v1(mask);
    numa_bitmask_free(mask);
  }

  free(fuzz_str1);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `numa.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause linking errors when compiling the code.
2. The `numa_parse_nodestring` function is not declared in the `numa.h` header. This can cause compilation errors.

To fix these issues, we can:

1. Wrap the `numa.h` header with `extern "C" {}`. This will ensure that the header is compiled in C mode, which is necessary for linking with the C++ code.
2. Declare the `numa_parse_nodestring` function in the `numa.h` header. This will allow the compiler to find the function definition.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
