Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "numa.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <numaif.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct nodemask_t *mask = NULL;

  char *fuzz_str1 = malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(fuzz_str1, data, size);
  fuzz_str1[size] = '\0';

  mask = numa_parse_nodestring(fuzz_str1);
  if (mask != NULL) {
    numa_bind_v1(mask);
    numa_bitmask_free(mask);
  }

  free(fuzz_str1);
  return 0;
}
```

The build issue is caused by the missing definition of `numa_parse_nodestring`, `numa_bind_v1`, and `numa_bitmask_free`. To fix this, the header file `numaif.h` needs to be included with the `extern "C"` wrapper.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
