Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  gnutls_session_int* session = gnutls_session_new(nullptr);
  if (session == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  const int ms = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 10000);
  gnutls_session_set_timeout(session, ms);
  gnutls_session_free(session);
  return 0;
}
```

Here's the explanation of the fix:

1. The error message "undefined reference to `gnutls_session_set_timeout`" indicates that the function `gnutls_session_set_timeout` is not defined in the current scope. This is because the header file `gnutls/gnutls.h` does not declare this function. To fix this, we need to include the header file that declares this function.

2. To find the header file that declares `gnutls_session_set_timeout`, we can search the GNU TLS documentation or use a tool like `ctags`. In this case, the function is declared in the header file `gnutls/session.h`.

3. We add the following line to the top of the file to include the necessary header file:

```c++
#include <gnutls/session.h>
```

4. After adding this line, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `size_t check_session_status(struct gnutls_session_int * session, int ms)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `size_t check_session_status(struct gnutls_session_int * session, int ms)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
