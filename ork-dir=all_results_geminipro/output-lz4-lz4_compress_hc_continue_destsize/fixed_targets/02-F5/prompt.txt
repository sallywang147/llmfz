Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "lz4hc.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  LZ4_streamHC_t* LZ4_streamHCPtr = LZ4_createStreamHC();
  if (LZ4_streamHCPtr == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const size_t src_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<char> src(src_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(src.data(), src_size);

  const size_t target_dest_size =
      stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<char> dst(target_dest_size);

  int src_size_ptr = src_size;
  const int ret = LZ4_compress_HC_continue_destSize(
      LZ4_streamHCPtr, src.data(), dst.data(), &src_size_ptr, target_dest_size);
  if (ret != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  LZ4_freeStreamHC(LZ4_streamHCPtr);
  return 0;
}
```
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'LZ4_compress_HC_continue_destSize'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `LZ4_compress_HC_continue_destSize`. This is because the header file `lz4hc.h` does not contain the definition of this function. To fix this error, you need to include the source file that contains the definition of this function.

In this case, the source file is `lz4hc.c`. You can find this file in the LZ4 source code distribution. Once you have found this file, you need to add the following line to the top of your source file:

```
#include "lz4hc.c"
```

This will include the source file `lz4hc.c` into your source file, and the linker will be able to find the definition of the function `LZ4_compress_HC_continue_destSize`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
