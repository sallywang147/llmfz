Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H

extern "C" {
#include <tttables.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  int load_flags = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 100);
  char glyf_table_only = fdp.ConsumeBool();

  FT_Library library;
  FT_Init_FreeType(&library);

  FT_Face face;
  FT_New_Memory_Face(library, data, size, 0, &face);

  FT_GlyphSlot slot = face->glyph;

  TT_Loader loader;
  TT_Size size;

  tt_loader_init(&loader, &size, slot, load_flags, glyf_table_only);

  FT_Done_Face(face);
  FT_Done_FreeType(library);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `tttables.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause linker errors when trying to build the code.
2. The `TT_Size` struct is not defined. This can cause compiler errors when trying to compile the code.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

1. Wrapping the `tttables.h` header with `extern "C" {}`.
2. Including the `ttsizes.h` header, which defines the `TT_Size` struct.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
