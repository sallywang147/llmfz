Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <map>

struct anon {
  size_t drop_deletes_without_resize(size_t pos) const { return 0; }
};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  std::map<uint32_t, int> m;
  const size_t num_items = fdp.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_items; ++i) {
    m[fdp.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>()] = fdp.ConsumeIntegral<int32_t>();
  }
  // Fix the undefined reference to 'anon::drop_deletes_without_resize'
  anon a;
  a.drop_deletes_without_resize(fdp.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>() % m.size());
  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `anon` struct was defined without a namespace, and the function `drop_deletes_without_resize` was not declared as `static`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the function when it was called in `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.

To fix the issue, the `anon` struct was defined inside the `extern "C"` block, which ensures that the struct and its functions are exported with C linkage. Additionally, the `drop_deletes_without_resize` function was declared as `static` to ensure that it is only visible within the `anon` struct.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
