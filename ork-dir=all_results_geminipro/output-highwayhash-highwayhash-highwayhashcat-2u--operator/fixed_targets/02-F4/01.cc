The issue in the original code was that the `HighwayHashCat` class was not being used correctly. The `operator()` function of the `HighwayHashCat` class takes several arguments, including the key, the fragments, the number of fragments, and a pointer to the result. In the original code, the `operator()` function was not being called with all of the required arguments.

To fix the issue, the `operator()` function was called with all of the required arguments. This allowed the `HighwayHashCat` class to compute the hash correctly.
