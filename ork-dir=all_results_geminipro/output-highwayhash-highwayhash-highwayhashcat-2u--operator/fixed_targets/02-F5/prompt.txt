Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_target.h"
#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_types.h"

using highwayhash::HHKey;
using highwayhash::HHResult64;
using highwayhash::HighwayHash;
using highwayhash::HighwayHashCat;
using highwayhash::StringView;

extern "C" {
#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_target.h"
#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_types.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(uint64_t) * 4) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Generate the key.
  const uint64_t *u64s = reinterpret_cast<const uint64_t *>(data);
  HH_ALIGNAS(32) const HHKey key = {u64s[0], u64s[1], u64s[2], u64s[3]};
  data += sizeof(uint64_t) * 4;
  size -= sizeof(uint64_t) * 4;

  // Generate the fragments.
  const size_t num_fragments = size / 2;
  StringView fragments[num_fragments];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_fragments; ++i) {
    fragments[i] = {data, size / 2};
    data += size / 2;
  }

  // Compute the hash.
  HHResult64 result;
  HighwayHashCat<2u>()(&key, fragments, num_fragments, &result);

  // Use the hash.
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `HighwayHashCat` class was not being used correctly. The `operator()` function of the `HighwayHashCat` class takes several arguments, including the key, the fragments, the number of fragments, and a pointer to the result. In the original code, the `operator()` function was not being called with all of the required arguments.

To fix the issue, the `operator()` function was called with all of the required arguments. This allowed the `HighwayHashCat` class to compute the hash correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
