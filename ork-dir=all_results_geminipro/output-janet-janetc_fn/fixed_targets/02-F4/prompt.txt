Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janetc.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the function */
  JanetSlot opts[1];
  janet_slot_init(opts, JANET_NIL);
  JanetFopts fopts;
  janet_fopts_init(&fopts);
  union Janet *args[1];
  args[0] = janet_wrap_string(data);

  janetc_fn(opts, &fopts, 1, args);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `janet_wrap_nil()` function was used to wrap the input data, which is not appropriate for fuzzing. The correct function to use is `janet_wrap_string()`, which allows the function to take the input data as a string.

The fixed code uses the `janet_wrap_string()` function to wrap the input data, which allows the function to take the input data as a string. This is more appropriate for fuzzing, as it allows the function to handle a wider range of input data.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
