Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janetc.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the function */
  JanetSlot opts;
  janet_slot_init_empty(&opts);

  JanetFopts fopts;
  janet_fopts_init(&fopts, &opts);

  /* Convert the data to a JanetBuffer. */
  JanetBuffer buffer = janet_buffer(data, size);

  union Janet v;
  janetc_fn(&opts, &fopts, &buffer, &v);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `janetc.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler cannot find the `janetc_fn` function.
2. The `janet_buffer` function is not declared in the `janet.h` header. This causes a compiler error because the `janet_buffer` function is used without being declared.

The fixed code wraps the `janetc.h` header with `extern "C" {}` and includes the `janet_buffer` function declaration from the `janet.h` header. This fixes the linker error and the compiler error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
