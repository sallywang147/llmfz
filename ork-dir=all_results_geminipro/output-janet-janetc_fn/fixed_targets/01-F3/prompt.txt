Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <janet.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <janetc.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the function */
  JanetSlot opts;
  janet_slot_init_empty(&opts);

  JanetFopts fopts;
  janet_fopts_init(&fopts, &opts);

  union Janet v;
  janetc_fn(&opts, &fopts, size, data, &v);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `janetc_fn` function takes four arguments, but only three were being passed. The fourth argument is the data to be fuzzed, and it was missing.
2. The `janetc_fn` function expects the data to be fuzzed to be passed as a `JanetBuffer`, but it was being passed as a `const uint8_t *`. This is incorrect because `JanetBuffer` is a Janet data type, and `const uint8_t *` is a C data type. To fix this, the data was converted to a `JanetBuffer` using the `janet_buffer` function.

The fixed code addresses these issues and should now work as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
