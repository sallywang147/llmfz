Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ldacBT.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

constexpr LDACBT_EQMID_T kEqmidValue[] = {LDACBT_EQMID_HQ, LDACBT_EQMID_SQ, LDACBT_EQMID_MQ};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  HANDLE_LDAC_BT hLdacBT = ldacBT_get_handle();
  if (hLdacBT == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  int eqmid = stream.PickValueInArray(kEqmidValue);
  int status = ldacBT_set_eqmid(hLdacBT, eqmid);
  if (!status) {
    return 0;
  }

  ldacBT_close_handle(hLdacBT);
  ldacBT_free_handle(hLdacBT);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'ldacBT_get_handle'
```
This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `ldacBT_get_handle`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the linker can find the definition of this function.

One way to do this is to add the header file that contains the definition of `ldacBT_get_handle` to the list of header files that are included in the source file. In this case, the header file that contains the definition of `ldacBT_get_handle` is `ldacBT.h`. So, we need to add the following line to the beginning of the source file:

```
#include "ldacBT.h"
```

After adding this line, the linker will be able to find the definition of `ldacBT_get_handle` and the error will be resolved.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
