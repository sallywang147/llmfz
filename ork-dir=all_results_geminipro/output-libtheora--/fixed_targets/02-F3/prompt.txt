Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The fixed code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace fuzzing {
namespace datasource {

class Base {
 public:
  template <class T>
  void Get(T* this_, std::exception* id, size_t) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
      result.push_back(stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString());
    }
    *this_ = result;
  }
};

}  // namespace datasource
}  // namespace fuzzing

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  fuzzing::datasource::Base base;
  std::vector<std::string> result;
  base.Get(&result, nullptr, 0);
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the fix:

1. The error message is: "undefined reference to `result'".
2. The variable `result` is not defined in the global scope, and it's used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
3. To fix the issue, declare `result` as a global variable.
4. The corrected code declares `result` as a global variable before the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
