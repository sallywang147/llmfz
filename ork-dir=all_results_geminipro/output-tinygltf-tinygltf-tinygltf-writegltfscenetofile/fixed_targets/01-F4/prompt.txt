Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define TINYGLTF_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "tiny_gltf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "stb_image.h"
#include "stb_image_write.h"
}

static void parse_intCoding4(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  tinygltf::Model model;
  tinygltf::TinyGLTF ctx;
  std::string err;
  std::string warn;

  const char *str = reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data);

  bool ret = ctx.LoadASCIIFromString(&model, &err, &warn, str, size, /* base_dir */ "");
  (void)ret;

  std::string output_file;
  bool embedImages = false;
  bool prettyPrint = false;
  bool writeBinary = false;
  bool useIndent = false;

  ctx.WriteGltfSceneToFile(&model, &output_file, &embedImages, &prettyPrint,
                          &writeBinary, &useIndent);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  parse_intCoding4(data, size);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

- The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function was declared with `std::uint8_t` as the first parameter, but the definition used `uint8_t`. This caused a compiler error.
- The `parse_intCoding4` function was declared as `static`, which is not allowed for functions that are called from C code.

The fixed code corrects these issues by changing the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function declaration to use `uint8_t` as the first parameter and by removing the `static` keyword from the `parse_intCoding4` function declaration.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
