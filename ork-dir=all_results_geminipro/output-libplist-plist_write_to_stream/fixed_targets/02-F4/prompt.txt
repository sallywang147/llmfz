Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no build issues. Therefore, no fix is needed.

```c++
#include <plist/plist.h>
#include <stdio.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, size_t size) {
  plist_t root_node = NULL;
  plist_from_openstep(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size, &root_node);
  if (root_node == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  plist_write_to_stream(reinterpret_cast<char *>(root_node), stdout, PLIST_XML_FORMAT,
                        PLIST_OPTION_NO_COMMENTS);
  plist_free(root_node);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
