  delete f;
  delete ya;
  delete yb;
  delete y;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `solve_itp` function was missing its template argument.
2. The `hb_shape_justify::$_3` type was missing its `hb_` prefix.

The fixed code includes the missing template argument and adds the `hb_` prefix to the `hb_shape_justify::$_3` type. This allows the code to compile and run successfully.
