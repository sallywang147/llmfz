Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  anon *f = new anon();
  double a = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double b = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double epsilon = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double min_y = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double max_y = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  double *ya = new double();
  double *yb = new double();
  double *y = new double();

  solve_itp<hb_shape_justify::$_3>(f, a, b, epsilon, min_y, max_y, ya, yb, y);

  delete f;
  delete ya;
  delete yb;
  delete y;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
