Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <mntent.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct mnttab mtab;
  struct mntent* mnt;
  FILE* fp = setmntent("/etc/fstab", "r");
  if (fp == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  while ((mnt = getmntent(fp)) != nullptr) {
    if (mnt->mnt_type != nullptr && strcmp(mnt->mnt_type, "fuseblk") == 0) {
      printf("Found a fuseblk mount: %s\n", mnt->mnt_dir);
    }
  }

  endmntent(fp);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mnt_table_parse_fstab` function is not declared in the `mntent.h` header file.
2. The `mnt_init_table` and `mnt_free_table` functions are not declared in the `mntent.h` header file.
3. The `mnt_table` struct is not declared in the `mntent.h` header file.

To fix these issues, we need to include the necessary header files and declare the missing functions and structs.

The corrected code includes the necessary header files and declares the missing functions and structs. It also uses the `setmntent`, `getmntent`, and `endmntent` functions to read the `/etc/fstab` file and find all the fuseblk mounts.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
