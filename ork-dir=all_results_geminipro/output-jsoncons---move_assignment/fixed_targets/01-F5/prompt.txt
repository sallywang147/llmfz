Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <jsoncons/json.hpp>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace jsoncons;

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, std::size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  json j1 = json::parse(input);
  json j2 = json::parse(input);
  j1 = std::move(j2); // Use move assignment operator
  return 0;
}
}
```

The original code uses the `move_assignment` operator, which is not supported by the `jsoncons` library. To fix this, we can use the `=` operator instead, which will move the contents of `j2` into `j1`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
