Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "public/myanmartools.h"

extern "C" {
#include "third_party/icu/source/common/unicode/utypes.h"
#include "third_party/icu/source/common/unicode/uchar.h"
#include "third_party/icu/source/common/unicode/utf8.h"
}

using google_myanmar_tools::GMTZawgyiDetector;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  GMTZawgyiDetector detector;
  std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  double result = GMTGetZawgyiProbability(&detector, const_cast<char *>(input.c_str()));
  (void)result;  // Avoid unused variable warning.
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Included the necessary ICU header files (`uchar.h` and `utf8.h`) inside the `extern "C" {}` block.
2. Changed the `GMTGetZawgyiProbability` function call to use `const_cast<char *>()` to convert the `std::string` to a `char *`. This is necessary because the `GMTGetZawgyiProbability` function expects a `char *` as its second argument.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
