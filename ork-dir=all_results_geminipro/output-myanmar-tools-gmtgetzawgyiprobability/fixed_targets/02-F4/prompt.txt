Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "zawgyi_detector/zawgyi_detector.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t input_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::string input = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(input_size);

  struct GMTZawgyiDetector detector;
  GMTInitZawgyiDetector(&detector);
  double probability = GMTGetZawgyiProbability(&detector, input.c_str());
  GMTDestroyZawgyiDetector(&detector);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that `GMTGetZawgyiProbability` expects a non-const pointer to a `char` array as its second argument, but the code was passing a `const_cast` of a `std::string` object. This caused a compilation error.

The fix was to remove the `const_cast` and pass the `input.c_str()` directly to `GMTGetZawgyiProbability`. This ensures that the function receives a non-const pointer to a `char` array, as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
