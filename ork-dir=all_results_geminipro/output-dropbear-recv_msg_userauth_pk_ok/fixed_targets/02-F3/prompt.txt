Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Read the username.
  std::string username = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);

  // Read the service name.
  std::string service_name = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(16);

  // Read the public key.
  std::vector<uint8_t> public_key = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024));

  // Read the signature.
  std::vector<uint8_t> signature = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024));

  // Call the function under test.
  recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok(username.c_str(), service_name.c_str(), public_key.data(), public_key.size(), signature.data(), signature.size());

  return 0;
}
```
The issue with the original code was that the header file `recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok.h` was not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok` function, resulting in the undefined reference error.

To fix the issue, the `extern "C" {}` directive was added around the `#include "recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok.h"` line. This tells the compiler to treat the contents of the header file as C code, rather than C++ code. This allows the linker to find the definition of the `recv_msg_userauth_pk_ok` function and resolve the undefined reference error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
