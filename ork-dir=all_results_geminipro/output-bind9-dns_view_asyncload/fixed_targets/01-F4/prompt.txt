Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include "dns.h"
#include "dns_view.h"

extern "C" {
#include "dns_view_private.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  char* arg = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString().c_str();
  dns_view* view = dns_view_create();
  dns_view_asyncload(view, provider.ConsumeBool(), nullptr, arg);
  dns_view_delete(view);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to fail to find the definition of the `FuzzedDataProvider` class.
2. The function `dns_view_create()` is not declared in any of the included headers. This causes the linker to fail to find the definition of the function.

To fix the code, we need to wrap the `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` header with `extern "C" {}` and declare the `dns_view_create()` function in a header that is included by the `dns_view.h` header.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include "dns.h"
#include "dns_view.h"

extern "C" {
#include "dns_view_private.h"
#include "dns_view.h"  // This line was added to declare the dns_view_create() function.
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  char* arg = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString().c_str();
  dns_view* view = dns_view_create();
  dns_view_asyncload(view, provider.ConsumeBool(), nullptr, arg);
  dns_view_delete(view);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
