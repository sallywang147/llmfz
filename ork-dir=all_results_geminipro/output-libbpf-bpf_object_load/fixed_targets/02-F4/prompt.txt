Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include "libbpf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "bpf_load.h"
}

static int libbpf_print_fn(enum libbpf_print_level level, const char *format, va_list args) {
  return vfprintf(stderr, format, args);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object *obj = NULL;
  bpf_object_open_opts opts = {};
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  obj = bpf_object__open_mem(data, size, &opts);
  err = libbpf_get_error(obj);
  if (err)
    return 0;

  bpf_object_load(obj, 0, NULL);
  bpf_object__close(obj);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. Included the `cstring` header to use the `strlen` function.
2. Wrapped the `#include "bpf_load.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the undefined reference error.
3. Added a check for the length of the data before opening the BPF object to avoid a potential buffer overflow.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
