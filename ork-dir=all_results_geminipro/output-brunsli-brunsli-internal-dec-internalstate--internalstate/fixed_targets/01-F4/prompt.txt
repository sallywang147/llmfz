Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../common/platform.h"
#include "../dec/internal_state.h"
#include <brunsli/brunsli_decode.h>
#include <brunsli/status.h>
#include <brunsli/types.h>

extern "C" {
#include <brunsli/decode.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  brunsli::internal::dec::InternalState* state = new brunsli::internal::dec::InternalState();
  brunsli::BrunsliStatus status = brunsli::BrunsliDecode(data, size, state);
  if (status == brunsli::BRUNSLI_OK) {
    delete state;
  }
  return 0;
}

extern "C" void brunsli::internal::dec::InternalState::~InternalState() {
  // Fix the destructor to delete the allocated memory.
  delete this;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
