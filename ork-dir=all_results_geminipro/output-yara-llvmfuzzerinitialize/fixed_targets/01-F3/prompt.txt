Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {
  // This is an example of how to use the argc and argv parameters.
  // This is not a required part of the fuzzer harness.
  // If you don't want to use them, you can remove this function
  // and the corresponding call to LLVMFuzzerInitialize.
  if (*argc != 2) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (strcmp((*argv)[1], "bar") != 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // Do something with data.
  // This is just an example, you can replace it with your own code.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (data[i] == 'a') {
      // Do something interesting.
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
}
```

The corrected code includes the necessary header file for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class and declares the `LLVMFuzzerInitialize` and `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` functions as `extern "C"`. This should fix the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
