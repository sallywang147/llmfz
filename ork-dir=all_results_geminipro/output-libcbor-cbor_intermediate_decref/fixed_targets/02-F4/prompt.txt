Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cbor.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cbor_load.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  cbor_load_result result;
  cbor_item_t *item = cbor_load(Data, Size, &result);
  if (result.error.code == CBOR_ERR_NONE) {
    cbor_item_free(item); // Changed from cbor_intermediate_decref(item);
  }
  // Removed cbor_decref(&item);
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

- Changed `cbor_intermediate_decref(item);` to `cbor_item_free(item);`.
- Removed `cbor_decref(&item);`.

Explanation:

- `cbor_intermediate_decref()` is used to decrement the reference count of an intermediate item that was created during decoding. In this case, `item` is not an intermediate item, so `cbor_intermediate_decref()` is not needed.
- `cbor_decref()` is used to decrement the reference count of an item. However, `item` is already freed by `cbor_item_free()`, so `cbor_decref()` is not needed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
