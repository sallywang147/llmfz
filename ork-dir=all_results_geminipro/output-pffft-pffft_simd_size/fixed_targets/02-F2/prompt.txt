Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'pffft_simd_size'
```

This means that the function `pffft_simd_size` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `pffft.h`.

The corrected code is:

```
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "pffft.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  (void)data;
  (void)size;

  // Call pffft_simd_size() to maximize code coverage.
  pffft_simd_size();

  return 0;
}
```

Now, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
