The issue with the original code was that the `#include` directive for `simdutf/public/simdutf.h` was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is declared in the `simdutf` library.

To fix the issue, we wrapped the `#include` directive for `simdutf/public/simdutf.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the symbols defined in that header file as C symbols, which allows the linker to find them.

With this change, the code should compile and link successfully.
