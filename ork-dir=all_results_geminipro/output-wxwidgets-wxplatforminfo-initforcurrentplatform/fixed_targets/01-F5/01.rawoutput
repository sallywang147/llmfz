```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <wx/platform.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  wxPlatformInfo platform_info;
  platform_info.InitForCurrentPlatform();
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the necessary `#include <cstdio>` directive, which is needed to use the `printf` function. It should now compile and run successfully.
