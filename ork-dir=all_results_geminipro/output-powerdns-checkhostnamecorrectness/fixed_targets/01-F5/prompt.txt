Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "packetcache.hh"
#include "statbag.hh"

extern "C" {
#include "dns.h"
}

StatBag S;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  if (size > std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max() || size < sizeof(dnsheader)) {
    return 0;
  }

  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  /* auth's version */
  try {
    static const std::unordered_set<uint16_t> optionsToIgnore{EDNSOptionCode::COOKIE};

    PacketCache::canHashPacket(input, optionsToIgnore);
    DNSResourceRecord r(input.data(), input.size(), sizeof(dnsheader), false);
    checkHostnameCorrectness(&r);
    PacketCache::queryMatches(input, input, r.qname, optionsToIgnore);
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
  } catch (const PDNSException &e) {
  }

  /* recursor's version */
  try {
    static const std::unordered_set<uint16_t> optionsToIgnore{EDNSOptionCode::COOKIE, EDNSOptionCode::ECS};

    PacketCache::canHashPacket(input, optionsToIgnore);
    DNSResourceRecord r(input.data(), input.size(), sizeof(dnsheader), false);
    checkHostnameCorrectness(&r);
    PacketCache::queryMatches(input, input, r.qname, optionsToIgnore);
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
  } catch (const PDNSException &e) {
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `checkHostnameCorrectness` function was not defined. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that contains the definition of this function. In this case, the header file is `dns.h`, which is already included in the code. However, it is not included with the `extern "C"` directive, which is necessary for the linker to find the definition of the function.

To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include "dns.h"` line with the `extern "C"` directive. This will tell the linker to look for the definition of the `checkHostnameCorrectness` function in the C library, which is where it is defined.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
