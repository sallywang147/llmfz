Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "cctz/civil_time.h"
#include "cctz/time_zone.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

  cctz::time_zone lax;
  std::string tz = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  if (cctz::load_time_zone(tz, &lax)) {
    std::string version;
    lax.version(&version);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `load_time_zone` function is not declared in the `cctz` library.
2. The `lax` variable is declared as `cctz::time_zone`, but the `cctz` library does not define this type.

To fix these issues, we can include the necessary header files from the `cctz` library and declare the `cctz::time_zone` type.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
