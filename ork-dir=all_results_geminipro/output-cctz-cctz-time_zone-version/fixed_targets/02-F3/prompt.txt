Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include "cctz/civil_time.h"
#include "cctz/time_zone.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cctz/time_zone_impl.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

  cctz::time_zone lax;
  std::string tz = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  if (load_time_zone(tz, &lax)) {
    std::string version;
    lax.version(&version);
    std::cout << "Version: " << version << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The build error message indicates that the function `load_time_zone` is not defined. This is because the header `cctz/time_zone_impl.h` is not properly included. To fix this, we wrap the `#include` directive for this header with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The original code does not print the version of the time zone. To fix this, we add a line to print the version of the time zone if it is successfully loaded.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
