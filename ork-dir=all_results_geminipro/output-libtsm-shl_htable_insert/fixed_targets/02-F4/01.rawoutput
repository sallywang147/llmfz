The issue was that the `shl_htable_insert` function was being called with an incorrect number of arguments. The function expects four arguments: the hash table, the key, the key size, and the value size. However, the code was only passing three arguments: the hash table, the key, and the value size. This was causing the build error.

To fix the issue, the code was modified to pass the correct number of arguments to the `shl_htable_insert` function. The fourth argument, the value size, was added to the function call. This fixed the build error and allowed the code to compile successfully.
