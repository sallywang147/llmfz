Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include <iostream>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is caused by the use of the `std::cout` stream without including the necessary header `<iostream>`. To fix this, we need to include the `<iostream>` header inside the `extern "C"` block.

The corrected code includes the `<iostream>` header inside the `extern "C"` block, ensuring that the necessary symbols are available for linking.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void _GLOBAL__sub_I_template.cpp()` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void _GLOBAL__sub_I_template.cpp()` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
