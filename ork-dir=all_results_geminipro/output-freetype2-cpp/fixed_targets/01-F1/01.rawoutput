```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include <iostream>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is caused by the use of the `std::cout` stream without including the necessary header `<iostream>`. To fix this, we need to include the `<iostream>` header inside the `extern "C"` block.

The corrected code includes the `<iostream>` header inside the `extern "C"` block, ensuring that the necessary symbols are available for linking.
