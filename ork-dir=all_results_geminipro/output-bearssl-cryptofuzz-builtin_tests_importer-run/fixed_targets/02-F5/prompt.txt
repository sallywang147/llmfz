Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "cryptofuzz.h"

extern "C" {
#include "union.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  union.anon* anon_struct = new union.anon;
  memset(anon_struct, 0, sizeof(union.anon));
  anon_struct->type = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<uint8_t>(0, 10);
  cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Run(anon_struct);
  delete anon_struct;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

- The `union` keyword is not followed by a name, which is required for a union declaration.
- The `cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Run` function is not declared in the code, so it cannot be called.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

- The `union` keyword is followed by the name `anon`.
- The `cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Run` function is declared in the `cryptofuzz.h` header file, which is included in the code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
