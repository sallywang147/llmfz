```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "cryptofuzz.h"

extern "C" {
#include "union.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  union.anon* anon_struct = new union.anon;
  memset(anon_struct, 0, sizeof(union.anon));
  anon_struct->type = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<uint8_t>(0, 10);
  cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer::Run(anon_struct);
  delete anon_struct;
  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the definition of the `union.anon` type. This is because the header file `union.h` is not included in the code. To fix this, we need to add the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include "union.h"
```

Additionally, the `union.h` header file needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to allow it to be used in a C++ program. This is because the header file is written in C, and C++ and C have different calling conventions.

The corrected code is shown above.
