Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "cryptofuzz.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t anon_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  char anon_bytes[1000];
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(&anon_bytes[0], anon_size);

  union anon {
    char anon_bytes[1000];
  };
  std::memcpy(&anon, anon_bytes, anon_size);

  cryptofuzz::Builtin_tests_importer importer;
  importer.Run(&anon);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Changed the type of `anon_bytes` from `std::vector<uint8_t>` to `char[1000]`.
- Changed the `std::memcpy` call to copy the data from `anon_bytes` to `anon`.

These changes fix the build errors and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
