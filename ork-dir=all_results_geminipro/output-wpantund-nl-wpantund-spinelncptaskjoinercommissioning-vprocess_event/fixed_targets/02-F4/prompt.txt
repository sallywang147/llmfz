Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "nl/wpantund/SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning.h"

extern "C" {
#include "nl/wpantund/SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning* obj =
      new nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning();

  const int event = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, event);

  obj->vprocess_event(obj, event, args);

  va_end(args);
  delete obj;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include "nl/wpantund/SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning.h"` is included twice, once inside and once outside the `extern "C" {}` block. This can cause compilation errors.
2. The function `vprocess_event` is declared as `void vprocess_event(void*, int, va_list)` in the header file, but it is defined as `void vprocess_event(nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning*, int, va_list)` in the source file. This mismatch can cause compilation errors.

To fix the issues, we can do the following:

1. Remove the duplicate `#include "nl/wpantund/SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning.h"` inside the `extern "C" {}` block.
2. Change the definition of `vprocess_event` in the source file to match the declaration in the header file.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
