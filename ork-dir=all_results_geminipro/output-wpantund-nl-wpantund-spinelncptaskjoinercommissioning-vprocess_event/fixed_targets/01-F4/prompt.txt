Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "nl_wpantund_SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning* task =
      new nl::wpantund::SpinelNCPTaskJoinerCommissioning();

  const int event = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  std::vector<uint8_t> args_buffer(1000);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(args_buffer.data(), args_buffer.size());
  va_list args;
  va_copy(args, args_buffer.data());
  task->vprocess_event(task, event, &args);
  va_end(args); // Added va_end to free the allocated memory
  delete task;

  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the provided code is that `va_end` was missing after `va_copy`. This is necessary to free the memory allocated for the variable arguments. Adding `va_end` resolves the issue and allows the code to build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
