Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "dwarf.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libdwarf/dwarf.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct Dwarf_Attribute_s attr;
  attr.at_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str();
  const short theform = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  const size_t attr_val = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  struct Dwarf_Rnglists_Head_s* head_out = nullptr;
  size_t entries_count_out = 0;
  size_t global_offset_of_rle_set = 0;
  struct Dwarf_Error_s* error = nullptr;

  dwarf_rnglists_get_rle_head(&attr, theform, attr_val, &head_out,
                              &entries_count_out, &global_offset_of_rle_set,
                              &error);
  if (head_out != nullptr) {
    dwarf_rnglists_head_free(head_out);
  }
  dwarf_error_free(error);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `dwarf_error_free` function was not called to free the `error` object, which resulted in a memory leak. To fix this, we have added a call to `dwarf_error_free` after the call to `dwarf_rnglists_get_rle_head`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
