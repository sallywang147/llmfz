Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "dpif.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct dpif dpif;
  struct netdev netdev;
  int port_nop;

  const size_t dpif_name_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* dpif_name = new char[dpif_name_size + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(dpif_name, dpif_name_size);
  dpif_name[dpif_name_size] = '\0';
  dpif.name = dpif_name;

  const size_t netdev_name_size =
      stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* netdev_name = new char[netdev_name_size + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(netdev_name, netdev_name_size);
  netdev_name[netdev_name_size] = '\0';
  netdev.name = netdev_name;

  int dpif_netdev_port_add_ret =
      dpif_netdev_port_add(&dpif, &netdev, &port_nop);
  delete[] dpif_name;
  delete[] netdev_name;

  return dpif_netdev_port_add_ret;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `dpif_netdev_port_add'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `dpif_netdev_port_add`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares the function is included in the compilation.

In this case, the header file is `dpif.h`. We can include it by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```
#include "dpif.h"
```

Once we have included the header file, the linker will be able to find the definition of the function `dpif_netdev_port_add` and the error will be resolved.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
