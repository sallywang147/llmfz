Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "dpif.h"

extern "C" {
#include "dpif-netdev.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct dpif *dpif = nullptr;
  struct netdev *netdev = nullptr;
  int *port_nop = nullptr;
  dpif_netdev_port_add(dpif, netdev, port_nop);
  return 0;
}
```
In this fixed code, the `dpif-netdev.h` header file is included within the `extern "C" {}` block, which is necessary for linking with the C header file. This ensures that the `dpif_netdev_port_add` function is properly declared and can be used within the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
