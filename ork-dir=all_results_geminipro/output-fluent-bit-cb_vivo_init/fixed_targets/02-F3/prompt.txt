Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cb_vivo.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct flb_output_instance ins;
  struct flb_config config;
  std::vector<uint8_t> data_buffer = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes<uint8_t>();
  char* data_ptr = reinterpret_cast<char*>(data_buffer.data());

  int ret = cb_vivo_init(&ins, &config, data_ptr);
  if (ret != 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  cb_vivo_destroy(&ins);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include "cb_vivo.h"` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to not find the `cb_vivo_init` and `cb_vivo_destroy` functions.

To fix this issue, wrap the `#include "cb_vivo.h"` header with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The function `cb_vivo_init` and `cb_vivo_destroy` are not declared as `extern "C"`. This causes the linker to not find the `cb_vivo_init` and `cb_vivo_destroy` functions.

To fix this issue, declare the `cb_vivo_init` and `cb_vivo_destroy` functions as `extern "C"`.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
