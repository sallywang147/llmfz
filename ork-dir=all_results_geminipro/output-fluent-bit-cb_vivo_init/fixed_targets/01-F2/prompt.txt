Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct flb_output_instance ins;
  struct flb_config config;
  const std::string data_str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* data_ptr = const_cast<char*>(data_str.c_str());

  cb_vivo_init(&ins, &config, data_ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `flb.h` is not included with `extern "C" {}` wrapped around it. This is necessary because the `flb.h` header file contains C function declarations, and the C++ compiler expects C++ function declarations.

2. The function `cb_vivo_init` is not declared in the `flb.h` header file. This means that the compiler does not know what the function's signature is, and it cannot generate code to call the function.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The header file `flb.h` was included with `extern "C" {}` wrapped around it. This tells the compiler that the function declarations in the header file are C function declarations, and it should not expect C++ function declarations.

2. The function `cb_vivo_init` was declared in the `flb.h` header file. This tells the compiler what the function's signature is, and it can generate code to call the function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
