Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "flb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct flb_output_instance ins;
  struct flb_config config;
  const std::string data_str = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* data_ptr = const_cast<char*>(data_str.c_str());

  cb_vivo_init(&ins, &config, data_ptr);
  cb_vivo_destroy(&ins);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that `cb_vivo_destroy` was not called to clean up the resources allocated by `cb_vivo_init`. This can lead to memory leaks and other issues.

The fixed code calls `cb_vivo_destroy` after `cb_vivo_init` to properly clean up the resources.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
