The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `flb.h` is not included with `extern "C" {}` wrapped around it. This is necessary because the `flb.h` header file contains C function declarations, and the C++ compiler expects C++ function declarations.

2. The function `cb_vivo_init` is not declared in the `flb.h` header file. This means that the compiler does not know what the function's signature is, and it cannot generate code to call the function.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The header file `flb.h` was included with `extern "C" {}` wrapped around it. This tells the compiler that the function declarations in the header file are C function declarations, and it should not expect C++ function declarations.

2. The function `cb_vivo_init` was declared in the `flb.h` header file. This tells the compiler what the function's signature is, and it can generate code to call the function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
