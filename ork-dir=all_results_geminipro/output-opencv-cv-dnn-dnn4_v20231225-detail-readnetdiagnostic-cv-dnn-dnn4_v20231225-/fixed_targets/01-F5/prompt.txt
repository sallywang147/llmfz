Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <opencv2/dnn.hpp>

extern "C" {
#include <opencv2/dnn/dnn4_v20231225/dnn4_v20231225.hpp>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzz_provider(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> net_data = fuzz_provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  cv::dnn::Net net;
  cv::dnn::dnn4_v20231225::detail::readNetDiagnosticFromBuffer(
      &net, reinterpret_cast<char **>(&net_data[0]),
      reinterpret_cast<char **>(&net_data[0] + net_data.size()));
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that the header file `opencv2/dnn/dnn4_v20231225/dnn4_v20231225.hpp` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C++ code, which is not compatible with the C interface that is expected by the fuzzer.

To fix the issue, the header file is wrapped with `extern "C" {}` as follows:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include <opencv2/dnn/dnn4_v20231225/dnn4_v20231225.hpp>
}
```

This ensures that the C++ code in the header file is not exposed to the fuzzer, and that the fuzzer only sees the C interface that is defined in the header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
