Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "hal_thread.h"
#include "iec61850_server.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const char *data, size_t size) {
  int out;
  MmsValue *value = NULL;
  value = MmsValue_decodeMmsData(data, 0, size, &out);

  if (value != NULL) {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024);
    char *result = MmsValue_printToBuffer(value, buffer, 1024);
    free(buffer);
    MmsValue_delete(value);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary header files for the `MmsValue_decodeMmsData`, `MmsValue_printToBuffer`, and `MmsValue_delete` functions. This should fix the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
