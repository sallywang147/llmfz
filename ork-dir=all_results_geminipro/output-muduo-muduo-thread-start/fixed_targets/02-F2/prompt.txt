Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "muduo/base/Thread.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  muduo::Thread thread;
  thread.start(&thread);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that it includes the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header without wrapping it in `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to have C linkage, but the function is defined with C++ linkage.

To fix the issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` in `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to compile the header with C linkage, which is compatible with the C++ linkage of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code includes the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header within an `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function has the correct linkage. This resolves the linker error and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
