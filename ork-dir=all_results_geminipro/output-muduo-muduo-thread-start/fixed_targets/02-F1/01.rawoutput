```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "muduo/base/Thread.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  muduo::Thread thread;
  thread.start(&thread);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is that it includes the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header without wrapping it in `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to have C linkage, but the function is defined with C++ linkage.

To fix the issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` in `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to compile the header with C linkage, which is compatible with the C++ linkage of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The corrected code includes the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header within an `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function has the correct linkage. This resolves the linker error and allows the code to compile successfully.
