```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "muduo/base/Thread.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  muduo::Thread thread;
  thread.start();  // Fix: Remove the &
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `start` method of the `muduo::Thread` class was called with an incorrect argument. The `start` method takes no arguments, so passing `&thread` was incorrect.

To fix the issue, the `&` character was removed from the `start` method call, so that it now calls `thread.start()` without any arguments. This is the correct way to call the `start` method of the `muduo::Thread` class.
