Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "wgnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const size_t bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto buf = std::vector<char>(bufsize);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(buf.data(), bufsize);

  const std::string arg = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  wgnutls_write(fd, buf.data(), bufsize, arg.c_str());

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that `wgnutls_write` was being called with a `const char*` argument, but the function expects a non-const `char*`. This caused a compiler error.

To fix the issue, the `const_cast` operator was removed from the call to `wgnutls_write`. This allows the function to be called with a non-const `char*` argument, which is what it expects.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
