Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "apr.h"
#include "apr_strings.h"

extern "C" {
#include "apr_strings.h"
#include "apr_hooks.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  apr_pool_t* pool = apr_pool_create_ex(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  register_hooks(pool);
  apr_pool_destroy(pool);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `register_hooks` function was not declared in the included headers. To fix this, the `apr_hooks.h` header was included and wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function is properly declared and can be used in the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
