Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "apr_pools.h"

extern "C" {
#include "apr_hooks.h"
}

extern "C" APR_DECLARE(apr_status_t) apr_pool_pre_cleanup_register(apr_pool_t *pool, void *data, apr_status_t (*cleanup_fn)(void *));

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  apr_pool_t* pool = apr_pool_create_ex(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  apr_pool_pre_cleanup_register(pool, nullptr, register_hooks);  // Register the register_hooks function with the pool
  apr_pool_destroy(pool);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. Added the necessary `APR_DECLARE` macro to the `apr_pool_pre_cleanup_register` function declaration in the `apr_pools.h` header.
2. Registered the `register_hooks` function with the pool using the `apr_pool_pre_cleanup_register` function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
