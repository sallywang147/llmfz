Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "pb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string message_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const pb_msgdesc_s* message_desc = pb_find_msgdesc(message_name.c_str());
  if (message_desc == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  const size_t message_size = pb_msgdesc_sizeof(message_desc);
  std::vector<uint8_t> message(message_size);
  if (!pb_encode_ex(nullptr, message_desc, message.data(), 0)) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made:

- The `#include "pb.h"` directive was wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the "undefined reference to" error.
- The `pb_find_msgdesc`, `pb_msgdesc_sizeof`, and `pb_encode_ex` functions were declared as `extern "C"` to ensure that they are exported with the correct linkage.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
