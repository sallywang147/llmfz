Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "leveldb/db.h"
#include "leveldb/iterator.h"
#include "leveldb/options.h"
#include "leveldb/status.h"

extern "C" {
#include "leveldb/c.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // Create a DBImpl object.
  leveldb::DBImpl *db_impl = new leveldb::DBImpl();

  // Create a FuzzedDataProvider object.
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Call the TEST_NewInternalIterator method.
  leveldb::Iterator *iterator = db_impl->TEST_NewInternalIterator(
      nullptr /* db */, stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(1024));

  // Delete the iterator object.
  delete iterator;

  // Delete the DBImpl object.
  delete db_impl;

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:

1. The `leveldb::DB` object was not being created before calling `TEST_NewInternalIterator`. This would result in a runtime error.
2. The `iterator` object was not being deleted before deleting the `db_impl` object. This would result in a memory leak.

The fixed code creates the `leveldb::DB` object before calling `TEST_NewInternalIterator` and deletes the `iterator` object before deleting the `db_impl` object. This fixes the runtime error and the memory leak.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
