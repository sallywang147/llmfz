Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

#include "gnutls/gnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  gnutls_session_int session;
  memset(&session, 0, sizeof(session));
  struct mbuffer_st *packet;

  size_t ret = gnutls_record_recv_packet(&session, &packet);
  if (ret != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  if (packet) {
    mbuf_free(packet);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
```
error: undefined reference to `mbuf_free'
```
</error>

The issue is that the function `mbuf_free` is not defined in the current scope. To fix this, you need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `gnutls/gnutls.h`.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

#include "gnutls/gnutls.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  gnutls_session_int session;
  memset(&session, 0, sizeof(session));
  struct mbuffer_st *packet;

  size_t ret = gnutls_record_recv_packet(&session, &packet);
  if (ret != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  if (packet) {
    mbuf_free(packet);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
