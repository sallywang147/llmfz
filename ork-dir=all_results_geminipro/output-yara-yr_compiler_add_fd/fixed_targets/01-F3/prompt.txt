Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "yacc.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int rules_fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string namespace_ = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct _YR_COMPILER compiler;
  int ret = yr_compiler_add_fd(&compiler, rules_fd,
                               const_cast<char*>(namespace_.c_str()),
                               const_cast<char*>(file_name.c_str()));
  if (ret == 0) {
    yr_compiler_delete(&compiler);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `yr_compiler_add_fd` and `yr_compiler_delete` functions are not declared in the `yacc.h` header file.
2. The `yacc.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

To fix the code, we need to:

1. Add the declarations for `yr_compiler_add_fd` and `yr_compiler_delete` to the `yacc.h` header file.
2. Wrap the `#include "yacc.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
