Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>
#include <cups/ipp.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const std::string resource = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  ipp_t* request = ippNewRequest(IPP_GET_PRINTER_ATTRIBUTES);
  ippAddString(request, IPP_TAG_OPERATION, IPP_TAG_CHARSET, "utf-8",
               "get-printer-attributes");
  ippAddString(request, IPP_TAG_PRINTER, IPP_TAG_NAME, "utf-8", "my-printer");

  cups_http_t *http = cupsConnectHttp(nullptr, 631);
  if (!http) {
    ippDelete(request);
    return 0;
  }

  ipp_t* response = cupsDoRequest(http, request, resource.c_str());
  if (response) {
    ippDelete(response);
  }

  cupsDisconnectHttp(http);

  ippDelete(request);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `cups/cups.h` and `cups/ipp.h` headers are not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because these headers are written in C and not in C++.

2. The `cupsConnectHttp()` function is not declared in the `cups/cups.h` header. This is because it is a function that is specific to the CUPS library and not to the C++ standard library.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The `cups/cups.h` and `cups/ipp.h` headers are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The `cupsConnectHttp()` function is declared in the `cups/cups.h` header.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
