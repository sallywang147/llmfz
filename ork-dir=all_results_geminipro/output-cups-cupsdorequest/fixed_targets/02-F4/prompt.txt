Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>
#include <cups/ipp.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(Data, Size);

  // Create a new HTTP connection.
  http_t *http = httpConnectEncrypt(nullptr, 0);
  if (!http) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Create a new IPP request.
  ipp_t *request = ippNewRequest(IPP_VERSION_1_1);
  if (!request) {
    httpClose(http);
    return 0;
  }

  // Generate a random resource string.
  const size_t resource_length = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *resource = new char[resource_length + 1];
  fdp.ConsumeBytes<char>(resource, resource_length);
  resource[resource_length] = '\0';

  // Send the IPP request to the server.
  ipp_t *response = cupsDoRequest(http, request, resource);

  // Clean up.
  ippDelete(request);
  ippDelete(response);
  httpClose(http);
  delete[] resource;

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `httpConnectEncrypt` function is not declared in the `cups` library.
2. The `ippNewRequest` function is not declared in the `cups` library.
3. The `cupsDoRequest` function is not declared in the `cups` library.
4. The `ippDelete` function is not declared in the `cups` library.
5. The `httpClose` function is not declared in the `cups` library.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The `httpConnectEncrypt`, `ippNewRequest`, `cupsDoRequest`, `ippDelete`, and `httpClose` functions were declared in the `cups` library.
2. The `#include <cups/cups.h>` and `#include <cups/ipp.h>` directives were added to the top of the file.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
