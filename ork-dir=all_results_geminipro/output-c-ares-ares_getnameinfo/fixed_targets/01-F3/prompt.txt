Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <ares.h>

extern "C" {
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netdb.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, unsigned long size);

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, unsigned long size) {
  struct ares_channeldata channel;
  struct sockaddr_in addr;
  int errcode;
  char host[NI_MAXHOST];
  func_type callback = [](void *arg, int status, int timeouts,
                          unsigned char *abuf, int alen) {};
  ares_init(&channel);
  ares_getnameinfo(&channel, reinterpret_cast<struct sockaddr *>(&addr),
                   sizeof(addr), NI_NUMERICHOST, callback, host);
  ares_destroy(&channel);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ares` library is not linked correctly. To fix this, the `ares.h` header needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `func_type` callback is not defined. To fix this, the `ares.h` header needs to be included.

The fixed code includes the `ares.h` header and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`. It also defines the `func_type` callback.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
