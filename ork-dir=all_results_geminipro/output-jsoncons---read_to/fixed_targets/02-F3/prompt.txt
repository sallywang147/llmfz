Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <jsoncons/json.hpp>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace jsoncons;

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, std::size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  json_reader reader(input);
  jsoncons::basic_json_cursor<char, jsoncons::stream_source<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > cursor(reader);
  jsoncons::basic_staj_cursor visitor;
  std::error_code ec;
  cursor.read_to(&visitor, &ec);
  if (ec) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", ec.message().c_str());
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
}
```

The original code had a compilation error because the `jsoncons::basic_staj_cursor` class was not defined. This class is defined in the `jsoncons/json.hpp` header file, but the header file was not included in the code.

To fix the error, the `#include <jsoncons/json.hpp>` line was added to the top of the code.

The original code also had a runtime error because the `cursor.read_to(&visitor, &ec)` line could throw an exception if the input JSON data was invalid. To fix the error, the `try-catch` block was added to the code to catch the exception and print an error message.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
