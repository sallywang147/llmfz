```

The following changes were made to the original code:

1. The header file `MQTTClientPersistence.h` was included inside the `extern "C" {}` block. This ensures that the function `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` is visible to the C++ compiler.
2. The function `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` was declared with the `extern "C"` keyword. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C header file and needs to be visible to the C++ compiler.

With these changes, the code should compile and run as expected.
