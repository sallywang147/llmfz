Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the `MQTTClient.h` header includes the `MQTTClient_public.h` header, which is declared as `extern "C" { }`. This causes the `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` function to be declared as `extern "C"`, but the function definition in the `MQTTClient.h` header is not declared as `extern "C"`, which results in a linker error.

To fix this issue, the `MQTTClient.h` header needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" { }` as well.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
#include "MQTTClient_public.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  struct _MqttDisconnect disconnect;
  int rc = MqttClient_Disconnect_ex(&client, &disconnect);
  return rc;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
