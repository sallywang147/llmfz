The issue is that the `MQTTClient.h` header includes the `MQTTClient_public.h` header, which is declared as `extern "C" { }`. This causes the `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` function to be declared as `extern "C"`, but the function definition in the `MQTTClient.h` header is not declared as `extern "C"`, which results in a linker error.

To fix this issue, the `MQTTClient.h` header needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" { }` as well.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClient.h"
#include "MQTTClient_public.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  struct _MqttDisconnect disconnect;
  int rc = MqttClient_Disconnect_ex(&client, &disconnect);
  return rc;
}
```
