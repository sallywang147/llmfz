Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "MQTTClient.h"

extern "C" {
#include "MQTTClientPersistence.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  struct _MqttDisconnect disconnect;
  disconnect.duration = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  disconnect.reasonCode = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  disconnect.sessionExpiryInterval = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  disconnect.serverReference = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>();
  disconnect.reasonString = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str();
  MqttClient_Disconnect_ex(&client, &disconnect);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the original code:

1. The header file `MQTTClientPersistence.h` was included inside the `extern "C" {}` block. This ensures that the function `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` is visible to the C++ compiler.
2. The function `MqttClient_Disconnect_ex` was declared with the `extern "C"` keyword. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C header file and needs to be visible to the C++ compiler.

With these changes, the code should compile and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
