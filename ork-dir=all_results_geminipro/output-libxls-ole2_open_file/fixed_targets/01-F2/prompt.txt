Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has the following issues:

1. The `ole2.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `ole2_open_file` and `ole2_close` functions are not declared in the `ole2.h` header file.

To fix the code, you need to:

1. Wrap the `#include "ole2.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`.
2. Declare the `ole2_open_file` and `ole2_close` functions in the `ole2.h` header file.

Here is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "ole2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  std::string str(bytes.begin(), bytes.end());
  char* file = const_cast<char*>(str.c_str());

  struct OLE2 *ole = ole2_open_file(file);
  if (ole) {
    ole2_close(ole);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should build and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
