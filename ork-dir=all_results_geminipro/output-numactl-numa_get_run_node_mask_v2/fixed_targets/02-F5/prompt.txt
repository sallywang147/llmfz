Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "numa.h"

extern "C" {
#include "numaif.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bitmask *mask = NULL;
  mask = numa_get_run_node_mask_v2();
  if (mask != NULL) {
    numa_bitmask_free(mask);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:
1. The `numaif.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `numa_get_run_node_mask_v2()` and `numa_bitmask_free()` functions are not declared in the `numa.h` header file.

The fixed code includes the `numaif.h` header file wrapped with `extern "C" {}` and declares the missing functions in the `numa.h` header file.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
