Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "proton/pn_config.h"
#include "proton/pn_transport.h"
}

extern "C" size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const char* buffer = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString().c_str();
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  struct pn_transport_t* transport = pn_transport();
  size_t result = pn_transport_output_write_sasl(transport, fd, const_cast<char*>(buffer),
                                       buffer_size);
  pn_free(transport);
  return result;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `pn_output_write_sasl` is not defined.
2. The function `pn_transport` is not defined.

To fix the first issue, the header `proton/pn_transport.h` needs to be included. To fix the second issue, the function `pn_transport` needs to be defined. This can be done by wrapping the `#include` directive for `proton/pn_transport.h` with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
