Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <unistd.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Generate argc and argv.
  const size_t argc = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 10);
  std::vector<char*> argv(argc);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
    const size_t arg_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 50);
    const std::string arg_str = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString(arg_size);
    argv[i] = new char[arg_str.size() + 1];
    strcpy(argv[i], arg_str.c_str());
  }

  // Call omain.
  int ret = omain(argc, argv.data());

  // Free argv.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
    delete[] argv[i];
  }

  return ret;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'omain'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `omain`. To fix this, we need to add the header file that contains the definition of `omain` to the `#include` directives.

In this case, the header file is likely `omain.h`, so we can add the following line to the top of the file:

```
#include "omain.h"
```

This will tell the linker to look for the definition of `omain` in the file `omain.h`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
