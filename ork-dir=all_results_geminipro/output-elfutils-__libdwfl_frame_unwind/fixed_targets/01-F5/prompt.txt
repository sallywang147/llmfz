Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "libdwfl.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libdwfl.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(Dwfl_Frame)) {
    return 0;
  }
  Dwfl_Frame state;
  memcpy(&state, data, sizeof(state));
  dwfl_frame_unwind(&state);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a build error because the `dwfl_frame_unwind` function was not declared in the `libdwfl.h` header file. To fix this, the `__` prefix was removed from the function name.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void __libdwfl_frame_unwind(struct Dwfl_Frame * state)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
