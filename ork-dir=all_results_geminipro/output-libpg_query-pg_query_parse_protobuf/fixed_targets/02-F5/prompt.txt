Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pg_query.h>

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h>
}

extern "C" {
PgQueryProtobufParseResult pg_query_parse_protobuf(const char *str);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  // Initialize the result struct to all zeros
  PgQueryProtobufParseResult result = {0};

  pg_query_parse_protobuf(new_str);

  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. The `PgQueryProtobufParseResult` struct is now initialized to all zeros before being used.
2. The `pg_query_parse_protobuf()` function is now declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for it to be visible to the C++ compiler.
3. The `pg_query_parse_protobuf()` function is now wrapped in an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C header file, and the C++ compiler needs to be able to find it.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
