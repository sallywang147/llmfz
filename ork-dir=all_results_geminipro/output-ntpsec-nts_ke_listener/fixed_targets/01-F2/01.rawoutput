```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.h>
}

extern int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { // ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.c

  char *arg = (char *)malloc(Size + 1);
  memcpy(arg, Data, Size);
  arg[Size] = '\0';

  nts_ke_listener(arg);

  free(arg);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.c` is included directly, which is not a standard C++ header file. This causes the compiler to treat the C code in that file as C++ code, leading to compilation errors.

2. The function `nts_ke_listener` is declared in the C code in `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.c`, but it is not declared in the C++ code. This causes the linker to report an undefined reference to the function.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Change the `#include` directive for `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.c` to `#include <ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.h>`. This will include the header file for the C code, which contains the function declarations.

2. Wrap the `#include` directive for `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the C code in that file as C code, preventing compilation errors.

After making these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
