The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. The `#include` directive for `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.c` was changed to `#include <ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.h>`. This includes the header file for the C code, which contains the function declarations.

2. The `#include` directive for `ntpsec/tests/ntpd/nts_ke.h` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the C code in that file as C code, preventing compilation errors.
