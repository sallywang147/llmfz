Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <capstone/alpha.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "capstone/capstone.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    cs_arch arch = CS_ARCH_ALPHA;
    cs_mode mode = CS_MODE_LITTLE_ENDIAN;
    cs_err err = cs_open(arch, mode, &handle);
    if (err) {
      return 0;
    }
    initialized = true;
  }

  struct cs_struct ud;
  ALPHA_global_init(&ud);

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t next_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0,
      provider.remaining_bytes());
  auto next_input = provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(next_size);
  cs_disasm(handle, next_input.data(), next_input.size(), 0x1000, 0, &all_insn);

  cs_free(all_insn, count);
  cs_close(&handle);

  return 0;
}
```

The main issue with the original code was that the `cs_open` function was called with incorrect arguments. The `cs_arch` and `cs_mode` arguments should be specified explicitly, instead of using the default values.

The corrected code specifies the `cs_arch` and `cs_mode` arguments correctly, and it also includes the necessary header file (`<capstone/alpha.h>`) to define the `ALPHA_global_init` function.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
