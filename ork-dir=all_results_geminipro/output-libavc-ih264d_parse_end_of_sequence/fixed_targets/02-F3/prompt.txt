Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "ih264d_api.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  avcodec_register_all();

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _DecStruct dec_struct;
  ih264d_init(&dec_struct);

  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    const size_t next_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
        0, stream.remaining_bytes());
    auto next_input = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(next_size);
    ih264d_decode_video_buffer(&dec_struct, next_input.data(), next_input.size());
  }

  ih264d_parse_end_of_sequence(&dec_struct);
  ih264d_release(&dec_struct);

  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added `avcodec_register_all();` at the beginning of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to register all the FFmpeg codecs. This is necessary for the `ih264d_decode_video_buffer` function to work properly.
2. Changed the `#include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>` line to `extern "C" #include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>`. This is necessary to prevent the linker from complaining about multiple definitions of the `avcodec_register_all` function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
