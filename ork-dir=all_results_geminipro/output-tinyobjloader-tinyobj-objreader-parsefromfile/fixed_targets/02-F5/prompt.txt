Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define TINYOBJLOADER_IMPLEMENTATION // define this in only *one* .cc
#include "tiny_obj_loader.h"

extern "C" {
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  // Define the constructor for `tinyobj::ObjReaderConfig` in the header file
  struct tinyobj::ObjReaderConfig {};
  tinyobj::ObjReader reader;
  std::string filename(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(Data), Size);
  reader.ParseFromString(filename, tinyobj::ObjReaderConfig());
  return 0;
}
}
```

Changes made:

1. Changed `reader.ParseFromFile` to `reader.ParseFromString` to parse the input data as a string instead of a file.

The original code had a build error because `tinyobj::ObjReaderConfig` was not defined in the header file. To fix this, the constructor for `tinyobj::ObjReaderConfig` was defined in the header file.

The original code also had a build error because `ParseFromFile` was not a member function of `tinyobj::ObjReader`. To fix this, `ParseFromString` was used instead, which is a member function of `tinyobj::ObjReader` that parses input data as a string.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
