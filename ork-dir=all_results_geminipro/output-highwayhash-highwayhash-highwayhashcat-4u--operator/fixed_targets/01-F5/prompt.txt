Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <vector>

#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_target.h"
#include "highwayhash/highwayhash_types.h"

using highwayhash::HHKey;
using highwayhash::HHResult64;
using highwayhash::HighwayHashCat;
using highwayhash::StringView;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(uint64_t) * 4) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Generate the key.
  const uint64_t *u64s = reinterpret_cast<const uint64_t *>(data);
  HH_ALIGNAS(32) const HHKey key = {u64s[0], u64s[1], u64s[2], u64s[3]};
  data += sizeof(uint64_t) * 4;
  size -= sizeof(uint64_t) * 4;

  // Generate the fragments.
  std::vector<StringView> fragments;
  while (size > 0) {
    const size_t fragment_size = std::min<size_t>(size, 1024);
    fragments.push_back(StringView(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), fragment_size));
    data += fragment_size;
    size -= fragment_size;
  }

  // Compute the hash.
  HHResult64 result;
  HighwayHashCat<4u>()(key, fragments.data(), fragments.size(), &result);

  // Return the hash.
  return result.high64();
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

- Added `extern "C"` before the `int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size)` function declaration to ensure that the function is visible to the linker.
- Added `return result.high64();` at the end of the function to return the hash value.
- Added the necessary `#include` directives for the `HighwayHashCat` class and the `StringView` type.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<4u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, size_t * hash) const` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void highwayhash::HighwayHashCat<4u>::operator(struct std::integral_constant * this, bool  key, struct highwayhash::StringView * fragments, size_t num_fragments, size_t * hash) const` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
