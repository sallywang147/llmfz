Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <re.h>

extern "C" {
#include <re_guts.h>
#include <lmatcher.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct re_guts* guts;
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Generate a random regex string.
  size_t regex_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> regex_bytes =
      provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(regex_size);
  char* regex = reinterpret_cast<char*>(regex_bytes.data());

  // Compile the regex.
  if (re_compile(&guts, regex, 0, 0) != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Generate a random input string.
  size_t input_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> input_bytes =
      provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(input_size);
  char* input = reinterpret_cast<char*>(input_bytes.data());

  // Match the regex against the input string.
  struct timespec timeout = {0, 0};
  lmatcher(guts, input, input_size, &timeout, 0);

  // Free the regex guts.
  re_free(guts);

  return 0;
}
```
The provided code is a fuzzer that generates random regular expressions and input strings and then matches the regular expressions against the input strings. The fuzzer uses the `re` library for regular expression matching.

The original code had the following issues:

* The `re_guts.h` and `lmatcher.h` headers were missing.
* The `re_guts` and `lmatcher` functions were not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ to link to C functions.

The fixed code includes the necessary headers and declares the `re_guts` and `lmatcher` functions as `extern "C"`, which should resolve the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
