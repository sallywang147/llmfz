Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <regex.h>

extern "C" {
#include <lmatcher.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Create a regular expression guts structure.
  struct re_guts *guts = (struct re_guts *)malloc(sizeof(struct re_guts));
  memset(guts, 0, sizeof(struct re_guts));

  // Initialize the guts structure.
  int err = regcomp(guts, (char *)stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes(), REG_EXTENDED);
  if (err != 0) {
    // An error occurred while compiling the regular expression.
    free(guts);
    return 0;
  }

  // Create a buffer to store the input string.
  size_t input_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *input = (char *)malloc(input_size + 1);
  memset(input, 0, input_size + 1);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(input, input_size);

  // Create a buffer to store the output string.
  size_t output_size = input_size * 2;
  char *output = (char *)malloc(output_size + 1);
  memset(output, 0, output_size + 1);

  // Create a timespec structure to store the timeout.
  struct timespec timeout;
  timeout.tv_sec = 1;
  timeout.tv_nsec = 0;

  // Call the lmatcher function to match the input string against the regular expression.
  int result = lmatcher(guts, input, input_size, &timeout, 0);

  // Free the allocated memory.
  free(guts);
  free(input);
  free(output);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

- The `lmatcher.h` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `lmatcher` function is declared in a C header file, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to use the C calling convention when calling this function.
- The `regcomp` function was not declared. This function is declared in the `<regex.h>` header file, so it needs to be included before using it.

The fixed code includes the necessary headers and wraps the `lmatcher.h` header with `extern "C" {}`. It also declares the `regcomp` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
