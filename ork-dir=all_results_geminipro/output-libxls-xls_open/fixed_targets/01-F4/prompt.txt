Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include "xls.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider Stream(Data, Size);
  std::string FileName = Stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct xlsWorkBook *WorkBook = xls_open(const_cast<char *>(FileName.c_str()), NULL);
  if (WorkBook) {
    xls_close_WB(WorkBook);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the `xls.h` header file within an `extern "C" {}` block, which ensures that the C functions defined in the header file are treated as C functions by the C++ compiler. Additionally, the `xls_open` and `xls_close_WB` functions are declared in the `xls.h` header file, which allows the compiler to recognize these functions and compile the code successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
