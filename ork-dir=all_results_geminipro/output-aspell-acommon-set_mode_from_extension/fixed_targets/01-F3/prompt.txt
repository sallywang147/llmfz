Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "acommon.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  acommon::PosibErr config;
  acommon::Config filename;
  const int length = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  char* in = new char[length + 1];
  in[length] = '\0';
  stream.ConsumeBytes(in, length);
  acommon::set_mode_from_extension(&config, &filename, in, length, nullptr);
  delete[] in;

  return 0;
}
```
In this fixed code:

1. Added `#include <cstring>` to include the `strlen` function.
2. Changed the size of the `in` buffer to `length + 1` to accommodate the null-terminator.
3. Added `in[length] = '\0';` to explicitly add the null-terminator to the `in` buffer.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
