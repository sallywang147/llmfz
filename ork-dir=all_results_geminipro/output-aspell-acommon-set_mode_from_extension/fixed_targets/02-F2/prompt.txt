Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "acommon/acommon.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  acommon::PosibErr config;
  acommon::Config filename;
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  set_mode_from_extension(&config, &filename, input.c_str(), 0, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a few issues:
- The `set_mode_from_extension` function was declared with the wrong return type. It should be `int` instead of `void`.
- The `input` variable was declared as a `const std::string`, but it was being passed to the `set_mode_from_extension` function as a `char*`. This is incorrect because `const std::string` cannot be implicitly converted to `char*`.
- The `set_mode_from_extension` function was being called with the wrong number of arguments. It requires five arguments, but only four were being passed.

The fixed code addresses all of these issues. The `set_mode_from_extension` function is now declared with the correct return type, the `input` variable is being passed to the function as a `char*`, and the function is being called with the correct number of arguments.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
