The original code had a few issues:
- The `set_mode_from_extension` function was declared with the wrong return type. It should be `int` instead of `void`.
- The `input` variable was declared as a `const std::string`, but it was being passed to the `set_mode_from_extension` function as a `char*`. This is incorrect because `const std::string` cannot be implicitly converted to `char*`.
- The `set_mode_from_extension` function was being called with the wrong number of arguments. It requires five arguments, but only four were being passed.

The fixed code addresses all of these issues. The `set_mode_from_extension` function is now declared with the correct return type, the `input` variable is being passed to the function as a `char*`, and the function is being called with the correct number of arguments.
