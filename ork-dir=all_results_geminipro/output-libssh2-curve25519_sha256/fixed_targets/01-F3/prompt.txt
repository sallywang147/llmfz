Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libssh2.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <kmdhgGPshakex.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  size_t session_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100);
  char *session = new char[session_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(session, session_len);

  size_t data_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100);
  char *data = new char[data_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(data, data_len);

  size_t public_key_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100);
  char *public_key = new char[public_key_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(public_key, public_key_len);

  size_t private_key_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100);
  char *private_key = new char[private_key_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(private_key, private_key_len);

  size_t exchange_state_len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100);
  char *exchange_state = new char[exchange_state_len];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(exchange_state, exchange_state_len);

  curve25519_sha256((LIBSSH2_SESSION *)session, data, data_len, public_key, private_key,
                     (kmdhgGPshakex_state_t *)exchange_state);

  delete[] session;
  delete[] data;
  delete[] public_key;
  delete[] private_key;
  delete[] exchange_state;

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

- The `#include <libssh2.h>` line was wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to fix the undefined reference to `curve25519_sha256`.
- The `(struct _LIBSSH2_SESSION *)session` and `(kmdhgGPshakex_state_t *)exchange_state` casts were removed as they are not necessary.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
