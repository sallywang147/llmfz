Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "skcms.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  float rx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float ry = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float bx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float by = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  struct skcms_Matrix3x3 toXYZD50;
  bool result = skcms_PrimariesToXYZD50(rx, ry, gx, gy, bx, by, wx, wy,
                                        &toXYZD50);
  return result ? 0 : 1;
}
```

The issue is that the `skcms.h` header file is not properly included. To fix it, the `#include "skcms.h"` line should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the `skcms.h` header file contains C-style declarations, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to treat them as such.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "skcms.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  float rx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float ry = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float bx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float by = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  struct skcms_Matrix3x3 toXYZD50;
  bool result = skcms_PrimariesToXYZD50(rx, ry, gx, gy, bx, by, wx, wy,
                                        &toXYZD50);
  return result ? 0 : 1;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
