Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "skcms.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  float rx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float ry = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float gy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float bx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float by = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  float wy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  struct skcms_Matrix3x3 toXYZD50;
  bool result = skcms_PrimariesToXYZD50(rx, ry, gx, gy, bx, by, wx, wy,
                                        &toXYZD50);
  return result ? 0 : 1;
}
```

The issue is that the `skcms_PrimariesToXYZD50` function is not declared in the `skcms.h` header file. To fix this, you need to add the declaration to the header file.

Here is the corrected `skcms.h` header file:

```c++
#ifndef SKCMS_H
#define SKCMS_H

#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct skcms_Matrix3x3 {
  float r00, r01, r02;
  float r10, r11, r12;
  float r20, r21, r22;
} skcms_Matrix3x3;

bool skcms_PrimariesToXYZD50(float rx, float ry, float gx, float gy, float bx,
                             float by, float wx, float wy,
                             skcms_Matrix3x3* toXYZD50);

#endif  // SKCMS_H
```

Once you have added the declaration to the header file, you should be able to build the code without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
