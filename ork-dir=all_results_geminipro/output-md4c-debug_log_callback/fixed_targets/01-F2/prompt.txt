Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstdio>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  size_t len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto str1 = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(len);
  len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto str2 = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(len);

  printf("%s %s\n", str1.data(), str2.data());
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'debug_log_callback'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `debug_log_callback`. To fix this, we need to include the header file that contains the definition of this function.

In this case, the header file is `<cstdio>`, so we need to add the following line to the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
```

After adding this line, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
