```c++
#include "../src/nokogiri_gumbo.h"

extern "C" {
#include <gumbo.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  GumboInternalError error;
  gumbo_init_error(&error);

  char *error_string = gumbo_error_code(&error);
  if (error_string) {
    free(error_string);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the necessary header file `gumbo.h` which contains the declarations for the functions and data types used in the code. To fix this, we have included `gumbo.h` using `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function and variable names.

The build error message also mentioned "undefined reference to `gumbo_init_error`", which means that the linker could not find the definition of this function. This is because the function is declared in `gumbo.h` but is defined in a separate library file. To fix this, we need to link the library containing the definition of `gumbo_init_error` with our program. This can be done using the appropriate linker flags during compilation.
