Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/nokogiri_gumbo.h"

extern "C" {
#include <gumbo.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  GumboInternalError error;
  gumbo_init_error(&error);

  char *error_string = gumbo_error_code(&error);
  if (error_string) {
    free(error_string);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. Included the necessary header file `gumbo.h` using `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function and variable names.
2. Added the necessary linker flags to link the library containing the definition of `gumbo_init_error` with the program. This can be done using the appropriate linker flags during compilation. The specific flags will depend on the platform and compiler being used.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
