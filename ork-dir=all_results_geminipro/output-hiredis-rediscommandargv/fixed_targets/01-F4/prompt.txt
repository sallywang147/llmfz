Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str, **argv;
  size_t *argvlen;
  int argc;

  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  new_str = malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  argv = &new_str;
  argc = 1;
  argvlen = NULL;

  redisCommandArgv(NULL, argc, argv, argvlen);

  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```
The fixed code includes the `hiredis/hiredis.h` header inside the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `redisCommandArgv` function is properly declared and linked. This resolves the undefined reference error.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
