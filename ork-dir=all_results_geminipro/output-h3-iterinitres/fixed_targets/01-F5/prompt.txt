Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'iterInitRes'
```

This means that the function `iterInitRes` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `iter.h`.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "iter.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(int)) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct IterCellsResolution res;
  int arg_0 = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  iterInitRes(&res, arg_0);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
