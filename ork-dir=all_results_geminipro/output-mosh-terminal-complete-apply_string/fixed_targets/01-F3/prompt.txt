Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "src/statesync/completeterminal.h"
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  std::string diff;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.apply_string(&diff);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an issue in the following line:

```c++
complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
```

The function `Parser::UserByte` is not defined in the code. To fix this issue, you need to include the header file that defines this function.

The corrected code is as follows:

```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "src/statesync/completeterminal.h"
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  std::string diff;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Terminal::Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.apply_string(&diff);

  return 0;
}
```

Now, the function `Parser::UserByte` is correctly defined and the code should compile without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
