Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "janet.h"

extern "C" {
#include "janet_cfun.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  /* init Janet */
  janet_init();

  /* fuzz the parser */
  JanetParser parser;
  janet_parser_init(&parser);
  for (int i = 0, done = 0; i < size; i++) {
    switch (janet_parser_status(&parser)) {
    case JANET_PARSE_DEAD:
    case JANET_PARSE_ERROR:
      done = 1;
      break;
    case JANET_PARSE_PENDING:
      if (i == size) {
        janet_parser_eof(&parser);
      } else {
        janet_parser_consume(&parser, data[i]);
      }
      break;
    case JANET_PARSE_ROOT:
      if (i >= size) {
        janet_parser_eof(&parser);
      } else {
        janet_parser_consume(&parser, data[i]);
      }
      break;
    }

    if (done == 1)
      break;
  }
  janet_parser_deinit(&parser);

  /* call cfun_ev_thread */
  union Janet *root = janet_parser_result(&parser);
  size_t ret = cfun_ev_thread(0, root);

  /* cleanup Janet */
  janet_deinit();

  return ret;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `#include` directive for `janet_cfun.h` was wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C++ code, and the linker needs to be able to find the definition of the function `cfun_ev_thread`.
* The definition of the function `cfun_ev_thread` was added to the file `janet_cfun.c`. This is necessary because the linker needs to be able to find the definition of the function in order to link the program.

With these changes, the program should now build and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
