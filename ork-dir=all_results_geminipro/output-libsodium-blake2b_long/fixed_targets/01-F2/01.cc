The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'blake2b_long'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `blake2b_long`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library that contains this function is linked with our program.

In this case, the library that contains `blake2b_long` is `libblake2`. We can link with this library by adding the following line to our build command:

```
-lblake2
```

For example, if we are using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), we would add the following line to our build command:

```
g++ -o fuzzer fuzzer.cpp -lblake2
```

Once we have added the necessary library, we should be able to build our program without errors.
