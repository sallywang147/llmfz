Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t n = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  std::vector<int> pwcs(n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    pwcs[i] = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  }
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8");
  mk_wcswidth_cjk(pwcs.data(), n);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. `mk_wcswidth_cjk` is not a standard C function. It is a function defined in the `libicu` library. To use this function, you need to include the `libicu` header file and link the program with the `libicu` library.
2. The `setlocale` function is not called to set the locale to a UTF-8 locale. This is necessary for `mk_wcswidth_cjk` to work correctly.

The fixed code includes the `libicu` header file and links the program with the `libicu` library. It also calls the `setlocale` function to set the locale to a UTF-8 locale.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
