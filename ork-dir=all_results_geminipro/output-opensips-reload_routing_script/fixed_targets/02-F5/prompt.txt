Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
}

void reload_routing_script() {
  // Implement the function here.
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  reload_routing_script();
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `#include <cstring>` directive was missing, which is needed for the `strlen` function used in the `reload_routing_script` function.
2. The `reload_routing_script` function was not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for the C++ compiler to recognize it as a C function.

The fixed code includes the missing `#include` directive and wraps the `reload_routing_script` function declaration with `extern "C"`, which resolves the build issues.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
