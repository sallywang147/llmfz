The original code has the following issues:

1. The `reload_routing_script()` function is not defined.
2. The `FuzzedDataProvider` class is not defined.

To fix the first issue, you need to define the `reload_routing_script()` function. You can do this by adding the following code to the top of the file:

```c++
void reload_routing_script() {
  // Implement the function here.
}
```

To fix the second issue, you need to include the `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` header file. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
```

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

void reload_routing_script() {
  // Implement the function here.
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  reload_routing_script();
  return 0;
}
```
