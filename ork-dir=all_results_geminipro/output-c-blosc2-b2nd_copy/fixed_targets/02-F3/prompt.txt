Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "b2nd.h"

extern "C" {
#include "b2nd_array.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  b2nd_context_s* context = b2nd_init();
  if (context == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  b2nd_array_t* array = b2nd_array_new(context);
  if (array == nullptr) {
    b2nd_destroy(context);
    return 0;
  }

  b2nd_array_t::b2nd_array_161** array_161 = nullptr;
  int result = b2nd_copy(context, array, &array_161);
  if (result != 0) {
    b2nd_array_delete(array);
    b2nd_destroy(context);
    return 0;
  }

  b2nd_array_delete(array_161);
  b2nd_array_delete(array);
  b2nd_destroy(context);
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following issues:
1. The `b2nd_array_delete` function takes a `b2nd_array_t*` as its first argument, but the code passes in a `b2nd_array_t::b2nd_array_161**` instead.
2. The `b2nd_array_delete` function is called twice, once with the `array` pointer and once with the `array_161` pointer. This is incorrect, as the `array_161` pointer is not a valid `b2nd_array_t*`.

The fixed code corrects these issues by passing the correct pointer to the `b2nd_array_delete` function and calling it only once, with the `array` pointer.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
