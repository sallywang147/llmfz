Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <opus/opus.h>

#include "libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h"

extern "C" {
#include "op_test.h"
}

// This is the function that will be called by the fuzzer.
// It takes a buffer of data as input and returns a size_t indicating
// the number of bytes that were processed.
size_t LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // Create an Ogg Opus file object.
  struct OggOpusFile *of = op_test_open(data, size);
  if (of == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Decode the Opus data.
  int ret = op_test_decode(of);
  if (ret < 0) {
    op_test_close(of);
    return 0;
  }

  // Close the Ogg Opus file object.
  op_test_close(of);

  // Return the number of bytes that were processed.
  return size;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
