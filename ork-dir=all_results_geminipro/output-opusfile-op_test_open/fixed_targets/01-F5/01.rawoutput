```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'op_test_open'
error: undefined reference to 'op_test_decode'
error: undefined reference to 'op_test_close'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of the functions `op_test_open`, `op_test_decode`, and `op_test_close`. This is because these functions are declared in the header file `op_test.h`, but they are not defined in any of the source files that are being linked.

To fix this, we need to add the source file that defines these functions to the build. This can be done by adding the following line to the Makefile:

```
SRC += op_test.c
```

This will tell the linker to include the file `op_test.c` when it is building the program.

Once this is done, the program should build and run without errors.
