Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "wgnutls.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int fd = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const size_t bufsize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  char* buf = new char[bufsize];
  const std::string arg = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const double timeout = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();

  int ret = wgnutls_read(fd, buf, bufsize, arg.c_str(), timeout);
  delete[] buf;
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

- The `wgnutls.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header is written in C and not C++, and the C++ compiler needs to know that the functions and variables declared in the header are C-style, not C++-style.
- The `wgnutls_read` function is declared as `int wgnutls_read(int, char*, size_t, const char*, double)`, but the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function calls it as `int wgnutls_read(int, char*, size_t, std::string, double)`. This is a type mismatch, and the compiler will generate an error.

To fix the issues, we can wrap the `wgnutls.h` header with `extern "C" {}` and change the type of the fourth argument of `wgnutls_read` from `std::string` to `const char*`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
