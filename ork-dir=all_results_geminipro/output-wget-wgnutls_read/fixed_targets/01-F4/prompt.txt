Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <wgnutls/wgnutls.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const int fd = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const size_t bufsize = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<char> buf(bufsize);
  const std::string arg = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const double timeout = provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();

  wgnutls_read(fd, buf.data(), bufsize, const_cast<char*>(arg.c_str()), timeout);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code is with the `wgnutls_read` function call. The fourth argument should be a `char*` pointer to a constant string, but the code was passing a `char*` pointer to a non-constant string. This can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.

To fix this, the `const_cast` operator is used to cast the `std::string::c_str()` result to a `char*` pointer to a constant string. This ensures that the `wgnutls_read` function is called with the correct type of argument.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
