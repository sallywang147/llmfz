```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "draco/src/draco/core/point_cloud.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  draco::PointCloud pc;
  pc.DecodeFromBuffer(data, size);  // Fix: Decode the point cloud from the input buffer
  bool result = pc.DeduplicateAttributeValues();  // Fix: Remove the pointer to `pc`
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had two issues:

1. The `draco::PointCloud` object `pc` was not initialized with any data. This is fixed by calling the `DecodeFromBuffer` method to decode the point cloud from the input buffer.
2. The `DeduplicateAttributeValues` method was called with a pointer to `pc` as the first argument. This is incorrect, as the method does not take a pointer to the point cloud as an argument. The fix is to remove the pointer to `pc` from the method call.
