Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <libical/ical.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *ical_string1 = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(ical_string1, data, size);
  ical_string1[size] = '\0';

  icalcomponent *ical1 = icalcomponent_new_from_string(ical_string1);
  if (ical1 != NULL) {
    icaltimetype start, end;
    icaltime_init(&start, 0, 0);
    icaltime_init(&end, 0, 0);
    icalcomponent_foreach_recurrence(ical1, &start, &end, NULL, NULL);
  }
  icalcomponent_free(ical1);
  free(ical_string1);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `ical.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to not be able to find the definitions of the functions declared in that header file.
2. The `icaltime_init` function is not declared in the `ical.h` header file. This causes the compiler to generate an error when trying to use that function.

To fix these issues, we can do the following:

1. Wrap the `ical.h` header file with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the linker to look for the definitions of the functions declared in that header file in the C language, rather than the C++ language.
2. Declare the `icaltime_init` function in the `ical.h` header file. This tells the compiler that the function exists and what its signature is.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
