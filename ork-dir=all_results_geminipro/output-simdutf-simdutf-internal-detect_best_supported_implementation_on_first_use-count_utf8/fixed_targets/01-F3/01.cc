      nullptr, const_cast<char*>(text.c_str()), text.size());

}
```

The fixed code:
1. Added the necessary header file `simdutf/utf8.h` for the `simdutf` library.
2. Wrapped the `#include "utf8.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to allow the object linking to succeed.

The `simdutf` library is a C++ library for working with UTF-8 encoded text. The `simdutf/utf8.h` header file includes the declarations for the `simdutf::internal::detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use::count_utf8` function, which is used in the code to count the number of UTF-8 characters in a given string.

By wrapping the `#include "utf8.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`, we are telling the compiler to treat the declarations in that header file as C declarations, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.
