Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "utf8.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string text = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  simdutf::internal::detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use::count_utf8(
      nullptr, const_cast<char*>(text.c_str()), text.size());
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:
1. Added the necessary header file `simdutf/utf8.h` for the `simdutf` library.
2. Wrapped the `#include "utf8.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to allow the object linking to succeed.

The `simdutf` library is a C++ library for working with UTF-8 encoded text. The `simdutf/utf8.h` header file includes the declarations for the `simdutf::internal::detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use::count_utf8` function, which is used in the code to count the number of UTF-8 characters in a given string.

By wrapping the `#include "utf8.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`, we are telling the compiler to treat the declarations in that header file as C declarations, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
