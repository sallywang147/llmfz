Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>
#include <woff2/decode.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t data_size) {
  size_t offset = 0;
  char dst[1024];
  woff2::Store255UShort(0, &offset, dst);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `stddef.h` header is not included, which is required for the `size_t` type used in the function signature.
2. The `woff2::Store255UShort` function is not declared in the global scope, which is required for the linker to find the function definition.

The fixed code includes the `stddef.h` header and wraps the `#include` directive for the `woff2/decode.h` header with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function declarations are visible to the linker.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
