Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <wavpack/wavpack.h>

extern "C" {
#include <wavpack/wavpack.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 100000);
  const size_t format_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  char* buffer = new char[buffer_size];
  char* format = new char[format_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(buffer, buffer_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(format, format_size);
  WavpackBigEndianToNative(buffer, format);
  delete[] buffer;
  delete[] format;
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The header file `<wavpack/wavpack.h>` was included at the beginning of the program.
2. The function `WavpackBigEndianToNative` was declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C library, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to look for the definition in the C library.

With these changes, the program should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
