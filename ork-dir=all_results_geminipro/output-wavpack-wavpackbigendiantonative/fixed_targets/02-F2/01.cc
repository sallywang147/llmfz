The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the definition of the function `WavpackBigEndianToNative`. This is because the header file `wavpack.h` is not included in the program. To fix this, we need to add the following line to the beginning of the program:

```c++
#include <wavpack/wavpack.h>
```

Additionally, the error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the definition of the function `WavpackBigEndianToNative`. This is because the function is declared in the header file `wavpack.h`, but the definition of the function is not included in the program. To fix this, we need to add the following line to the beginning of the program:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include <wavpack/wavpack.h>
}
```

This will tell the compiler to look for the definition of the function in the C library, which is where it is located.

With these changes, the program should compile and run without errors.
