```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The header file `<wavpack/wavpack.h>` was included at the beginning of the program.
2. The function `WavpackBigEndianToNative` was declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the function is defined in a C library, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to look for the definition in the C library.

With these changes, the program should compile and run without errors.
