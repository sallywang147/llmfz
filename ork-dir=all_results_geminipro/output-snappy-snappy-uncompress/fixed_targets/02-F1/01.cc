The code has the following issues:
- `zlib.h` is not included.
- `snappy::Uncompress` is not declared.

To fix the first issue, include `zlib.h` with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C-style header is properly linked.

To fix the second issue, include the necessary header file for `snappy::Uncompress`. In this case, it is `snappy.h`.

The corrected code is provided above.
