Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "lodepng.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const int w = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int h = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int colortype = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int bitdepth = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string image_data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  std::vector<unsigned char> png;
  int error = lodepng::encode(png, image_data.c_str(), w, h, colortype, bitdepth);
  if (error != 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  std::ofstream file(filename, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
  file.write((char*)png.data(), png.size());
  file.close();
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:
1. The error message indicates that the `lodepng.h` header is not properly included. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include "lodepng.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}`. This is because `lodepng.h` is a C header file, and we are compiling C++ code. The `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to treat the contents of the header file as C code.
2. The error message also indicates that the `std::ofstream` class is not properly included. To fix this, we need to include the `<fstream>` header file.

The corrected code includes the necessary header files and wraps the `lodepng.h` header with `extern "C" {}`. This should fix the build issues and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
