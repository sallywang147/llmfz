Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_pool_compat.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSPoolCompat *pool = new APFSPoolCompat();
  pool->poolstat(nullptr);
  delete pool;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `apfs_pool_compat.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header contains C++ code, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as `extern "C"`, which means it expects to be called from C code.

2. The `poolstat` method of the `APFSPoolCompat` class is not declared as `extern "C"`. This is necessary because the method is implemented in C++, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as `extern "C"`, which means it expects to be called from C code.

To fix these issues, the `apfs_pool_compat.h` header and the `poolstat` method of the `APFSPoolCompat` class are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" {
#include "apfs_pool_compat.h"
}

extern "C" {
class APFSPoolCompat {
 public:
  APFSPoolCompat() {}
  ~APFSPoolCompat() {}
  void poolstat(const char *path) {
    // Do something.
  }
};
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSPoolCompat *pool = new APFSPoolCompat();
  pool->poolstat(nullptr);
  delete pool;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
