Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_pool_compat.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSPoolCompat *pool = new APFSPoolCompat();
  pool->poolstat(nullptr);
  delete pool;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code is missing the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header, which is necessary for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. To fix the issue, the header is included inside an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with `extern "C"`, which means it uses C linkage. The `extern "C" {}` block ensures that the header is compiled with C linkage as well, preventing a linker error.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
