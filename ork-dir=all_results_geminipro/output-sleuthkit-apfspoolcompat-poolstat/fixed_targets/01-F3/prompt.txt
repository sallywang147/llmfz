Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_compat.h"

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);
  APFSPoolCompat pool;
  if (!pool.open(fuzzed_data)) {
    return 0;
  }
  char result = pool.poolstat(nullptr);
  pool.close();
  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the `FuzzedDataProvider` constructor was called with `data` and `size` as arguments, which is incorrect. The constructor should be called with a `FuzzedDataProvider` object as an argument. To fix this, the `FuzzedDataProvider` constructor is called with `fuzzed_data` as an argument.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
