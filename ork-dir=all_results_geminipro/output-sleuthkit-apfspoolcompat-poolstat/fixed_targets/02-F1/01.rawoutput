```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "apfs_pool_compat.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  APFSPoolCompat *pool = new APFSPoolCompat();
  pool->poolstat(nullptr);
  delete pool;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code is missing the `llvm/FuzzMutator.h` header, which is necessary for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. To fix the issue, the header is included inside an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary because the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared with `extern "C"`, which means it uses C linkage. The `extern "C" {}` block ensures that the header is compiled with C linkage as well, preventing a linker error.
