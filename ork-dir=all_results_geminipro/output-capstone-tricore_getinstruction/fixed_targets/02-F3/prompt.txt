Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "TriCore_Disassembler.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t handle = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t byte_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<char> bytes(byte_len);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(bytes.data(), byte_len);
  struct MCInst mi;
  memset(&mi, 0, sizeof(mi));
  short size;
  const size_t address = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<char> info(stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes<char>());

  TriCore_getInstruction(handle, bytes.data(), byte_len, &mi, &size, address,
                         info.data());
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `TriCore_Disassembler.h` is not properly wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to be unable to find the definition of the function `TriCore_getInstruction`.

To fix this issue, the `#include` directive for `TriCore_Disassembler.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The function `TriCore_getInstruction` is not declared as `extern "C"`. This causes the linker to be unable to find the definition of the function.

To fix this issue, the function `TriCore_getInstruction` is declared as `extern "C"`.

After applying these fixes, the code should compile and link successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
