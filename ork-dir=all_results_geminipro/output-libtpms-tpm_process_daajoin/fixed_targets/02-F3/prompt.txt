Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <libtpms/tpm_error.h>
#include <libtpms/tpm_library.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libtpms/tpm_daa.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct tdTPM_STATE tpm_state;
  struct tdTPM_STORE_BUFFER response;
  short tag = 0;
  int paramSize = 0;
  int ordinal = 0;
  char *command = NULL;
  struct tdTPM_TRANSPORT_INTERNAL transportInternal;

  TPM_Process_DAAJoin(&tpm_state, &response, tag, paramSize, ordinal, command,
                      &transportInternal);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
