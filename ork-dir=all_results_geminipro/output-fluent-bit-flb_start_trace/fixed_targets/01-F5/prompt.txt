Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to `flb_create_ctx'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `flb_create_ctx`. This is because the header file `flb.h` is included with `extern "C"`, but the definition of the function is not wrapped with `extern "C"`.

To fix this, we need to wrap the definition of the function `flb_create_ctx` with `extern "C"`. We can do this by adding the following line to the top of the file `flb.h`:

```
extern "C" {
```

And adding the following line to the bottom of the file `flb.h`:

```
}
```

This will tell the linker that the definition of the function `flb_create_ctx` is in a C file, and not a C++ file.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "flb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct flb_lib_ctx* ctx = flb_create_ctx();
  flb_start_trace(ctx);

  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  flb_write_trace(ctx, bytes.data(), bytes.size());
  flb_stop_trace(ctx);
  flb_destroy_ctx(ctx);
  return 0;
}
```

This code should now build and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
