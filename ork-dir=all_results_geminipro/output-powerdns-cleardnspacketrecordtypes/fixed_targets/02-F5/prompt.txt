Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no errors. It compiles and runs successfully. Therefore, no fixes are needed.

```c++
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "clearDNSPacketRecordTypes.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::vector<std::string> v;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> m;
  clearDNSPacketRecordTypes(&v, &m);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
