Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no build issues. The error message is not shown, so it is not possible to identify the exact issue.
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>

#include <libssh/libssh.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    ssh_init();
    initialized = true;
  }
  int ret;
  ssh_session session = ssh_new();
  if (session == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");

  ret = ssh_connect(session);
  if (ret != SSH_OK) {
    ssh_free(session);
    return 0;
  }

  ssh_userauth_agent_pubkey(session, nullptr, nullptr);

  ssh_disconnect(session);
  ssh_free(session);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
