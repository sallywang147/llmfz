Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no build issues. The error message is not shown, so it is not possible to identify the exact issue.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `int ssh_userauth_agent_pubkey(struct ssh_session_struct 521 * session, char * username, struct ssh_public_key_struct * publickey)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `int ssh_userauth_agent_pubkey(struct ssh_session_struct 521 * session, char * username, struct ssh_public_key_struct * publickey)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
