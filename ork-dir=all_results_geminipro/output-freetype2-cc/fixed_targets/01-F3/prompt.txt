Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <ftfuzzer.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  void* _GLOBAL__sub_I_ftfuzzer_cc = stream.ConsumeBytes<void>(size);
  ((void (*)())_GLOBAL__sub_I_ftfuzzer_cc)();
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The function `_GLOBAL__sub_I_ftfuzzer_cc` is declared as a `void*`, but it is called as a function pointer. This is incorrect and will result in a compiler error. To fix this, the function pointer should be cast to a `void (*)()` before calling it.

2. The header file `ftfuzzer.h` is not included with the `extern "C"` directive. This is necessary to ensure that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is exported with the correct C linkage.

The corrected code fixes these issues by casting the function pointer correctly and including the `ftfuzzer.h` header with the `extern "C"` directive.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
