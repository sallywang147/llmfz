Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <cassert>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "snappy.h"

// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  snappy::SnappyScatteredWriter writer;
  snappy::SnappyDecompressor decompressor;
  bool uncompress_succeeded = snappy::InternalUncompressAllTags<
      snappy::SnappyScatteredWriter<snappy::SnappySinkAllocator> >(
      &decompressor, &writer, input.size(), input.size());

  (void)uncompress_succeeded; // Variable only used in debug builds.
  assert(uncompress_succeeded);

  std::vector<std::string> uncompressed_pieces;
  writer.UnScatter(&uncompressed_pieces);

  std::string uncompressed;
  for (const std::string &piece : uncompressed_pieces) {
    uncompressed.append(piece);
  }

  assert(input == uncompressed);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
