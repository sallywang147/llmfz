```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "cpu.h"
#include "disas.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }

  struct CPUMIPSState* env = (struct CPUMIPSState*)malloc(sizeof(struct CPUMIPSState));
  memset(env, 0, sizeof(struct CPUMIPSState));

  struct DisasContext* ctx = (struct DisasContext*)malloc(sizeof(struct DisasContext));
  memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(struct DisasContext));

  decode_nanomips_32_48_opc(env, ctx, data, size);  // Pass the data and size to the function

  free(env);
  free(ctx);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `#include` directives for `cpu.h` and `disas.h` were not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions in these headers.
2. The `decode_nanomips_32_48_opc` function was not declared with `extern "C"`, which is necessary for C++ to be able to call a C function.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues. The `#include` directives for `cpu.h` and `disas.h` are now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, and the `decode_nanomips_32_48_opc` function is declared with `extern "C"`. This should allow the code to compile and link successfully.
