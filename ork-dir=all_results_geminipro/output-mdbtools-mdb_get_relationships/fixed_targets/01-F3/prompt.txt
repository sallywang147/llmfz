Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "mdbtools.h"

extern "C" {
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  MdbHandle *mdb = mdb_open_buffer((void *)Data, Size, MDB_NOFLAGS);
  if (mdb) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);
    std::string dbnamespace = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    std::string tablename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    mdb_get_relationships(mdb, dbnamespace.c_str(), tablename.c_str());
    mdb_close(mdb);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The issue was that the `mdb_get_relationships` function expects non-const char pointers, but the code was passing in const char pointers. This caused a compiler error.

To fix the issue, the code was modified to cast the `dbnamespace` and `tablename` strings to non-const char pointers before passing them to the `mdb_get_relationships` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
