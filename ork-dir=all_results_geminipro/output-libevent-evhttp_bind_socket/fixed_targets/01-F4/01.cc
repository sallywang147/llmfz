The issues and the fixes are as follows:

1. The error message indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_bind_socket`. This is because the `evhttp_bind_socket` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

2. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_start`. This is because the `evhttp_start` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

3. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_request_new`. This is because the `evhttp_request_new` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

4. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_add_header`. This is because the `evhttp_add_header` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

5. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evbuffer_new`. This is because the `evbuffer_new` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

6. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evbuffer_add_printf`. This is because the `evbuffer_add_printf` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

7. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_add_header`. This is because the `evhttp_add_header` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

8. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evbuffer_prepend_buffer`. This is because the `evbuffer_prepend_buffer` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

9. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evbuffer_free`. This is because the `evbuffer_free` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

10. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_connection_base_new`. This is because the `evhttp_connection_base_new` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

11. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_connection_set_timeout`. This is because the `evhttp_connection_set_timeout` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

12. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_make_request`. This is because the `evhttp_make_request` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.

13. The error message also indicates that there is an undefined reference to `evhttp_request_free`. This is because the `evhttp_request_free` function is declared in the `libevent` library, but the `libevent` library is not linked to the program. To fix this, you need to add the `-lev` flag to the linker command line.
