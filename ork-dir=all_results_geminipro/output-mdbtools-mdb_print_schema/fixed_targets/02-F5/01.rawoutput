```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include "mdbtools.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  MdbHandle *mdb = mdb_open_buffer((void *)Data, Size, MDB_NOFLAGS);
  if (mdb) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);

    std::string tabname = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    std::string dbnamespace = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    int export_options = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

    mdb_print_schema(mdb, stdout, const_cast<char *>(tabname.c_str()),
                     const_cast<char *>(dbnamespace.c_str()), export_options);
    mdb_close(mdb);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `mdbtools.h` header was not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to not be able to find the `mdb_open_buffer`, `mdb_print_schema`, and `mdb_close` functions.
2. The `mdb_print_schema` function was called with an incorrect number of arguments. It should have been called with 5 arguments, but it was only called with 4.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues. The `mdbtools.h` header is now wrapped in `extern "C" {}`, and the `mdb_print_schema` function is called with the correct number of arguments.
