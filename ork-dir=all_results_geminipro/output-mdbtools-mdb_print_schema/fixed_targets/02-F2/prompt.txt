Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include "mdbtools.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  MdbHandle *mdb = mdb_open_buffer((void *)Data, Size, MDB_NOFLAGS);
  if (mdb) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);

    std::string tabname = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    std::string dbnamespace = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
    int export_options = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

    mdb_print_schema(mdb, stdout, const_cast<char *>(tabname.c_str()),
                     const_cast<char *>(dbnamespace.c_str()), export_options);
    mdb_close(mdb);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. It was missing the necessary C standard library headers `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`, which are required for functions like `printf` and `exit`.

2. The `mdbtools.h` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for C++ to correctly link with C code.

The fixed code includes the necessary headers and wraps the `mdbtools.h` header with `extern "C" {}`, resolving the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
