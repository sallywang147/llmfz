Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the `ck_double_hash_insert` function is not declared in the code. To fix this, you need to include the header file that declares this function.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <ck_pr.h>
#include <ck_hash.h>
#include <ck_md.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  ck_hash_t hash;
  ck_hash_init(&hash, CK_MD5_HASH);

  struct ck_hash_table_s *table = ck_hash_new(&hash, CK_MD5_HASH, 1024);
  if (table == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(Data, Size);

  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    double key = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
    std::string value = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

    ck_double_hash_insert(key, value.c_str(), table);
  }

  ck_hash_destroy(table);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
