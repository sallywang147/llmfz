Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "wx/mem.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  size_t wxGetFreeMemory() = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the function `wxGetFreeMemory` is declared but not defined. To fix this, we need to include the header file `wx/wx.h` which contains the definition of this function. However, since this header file is written in C, we need to wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function name.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
