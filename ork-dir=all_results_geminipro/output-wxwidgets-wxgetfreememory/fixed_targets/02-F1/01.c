}
```

The issue is that the function `wxGetFreeMemory` is declared but not defined. To fix this, we need to include the header file `wx/wx.h` which contains the definition of this function. However, since this header file is written in C, we need to wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function name.
