Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "wx/mem.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  size_t free_memory = wxGetFreeMemory();
  if (free_memory == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  const size_t bytes_to_allocate =
      stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, free_memory);
  void* ptr = malloc(bytes_to_allocate);
  if (ptr == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  free(ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include <wx/wx.h>` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the function `wxGetFreeMemory()` to be declared with C linkage, but the header `wx/wx.h` declares it with C++ linkage.

2. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` is not declared with `extern "C"`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the function to be declared with C linkage, but the function is declared with C++ linkage.

To fix these issues, the header `#include <wx/wx.h>` and the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function `wxGetFreeMemory()` is declared with C linkage and that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()` is declared with C linkage.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
