Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libbpf.h"

extern "C" {
#include <errno.h>
}

static int libbpf_print_fn(enum libbpf_print_level level, const char *format, va_list args) { return 0; }

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct bpf_object_skeleton *s = NULL;
  DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_object_open_opts, opts);
  int err;

  libbpf_set_print(libbpf_print_fn);

  opts.object_name = "fuzz-object";
  s = bpf_object__open_mem(data, size, &opts);
  err = libbpf_get_error(s);
  if (err) {
    if (err == -ENOENT) {
      return 0;
    }
    return -1;
  }

  err = bpf_object__load_skeleton(s);
  if (err)
    return -1;

  bpf_object__close(s);
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Wrapped the `#include <errno.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to fix the "undefined reference to" error.
2. Added a check for the `ENOENT` error code when opening the BPF object. This error is returned when the BPF program is not found, which is a valid case for fuzzing. In this case, the function returns 0 to indicate success.
3. Changed the return value of `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to `-1` in case of an error.

The code has the following build issues:

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
