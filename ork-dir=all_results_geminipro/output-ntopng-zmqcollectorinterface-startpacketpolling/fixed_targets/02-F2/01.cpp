extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  ZMQCollectorInterface* interface = new ZMQCollectorInterface();
  interface->startPacketPolling(interface);
  delete interface;
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the following changes were made:

1. Added the necessary `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include` directives for the LLVM headers (`llvm/Support/CommandLine.h` and `llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h`). This ensures that the C++ compiler generates compatible symbols for linking with the C code.

2. Removed the `extern "C"` declaration before the `ZMQCollectorInterface` class definition. This is because the class is defined in a separate header file and is already declared as `extern "C"` there.

With these changes, the code should now compile and link successfully.
