Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "zydis/Zydis.h"
#include "zydis/ZydisFormatter.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 1024);
  uint8_t* buffer = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(
      std::malloc(sizeof(uint8_t) * buffer_size));
  stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(buffer, buffer_size);

  ZydisFormatterBuffer formatter_buffer;
  ZydisFormatterBufferInit(&formatter_buffer, buffer, buffer_size);

  ZyanString* string = nullptr;
  ZydisFormatterBufferGetString(&formatter_buffer, &string);
  ZyanStringDestroy(string);

  std::free(buffer);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include` directives for `zydis/Zydis.h` and `zydis/ZydisFormatter.h` to ensure that the C++ functions are exported with C linkage. This is necessary because the fuzzer driver is written in C and needs to be able to call the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

2. Corrected the spelling of `ZydisFormatterBufferGetString` to `ZydisFormatterBufferGetStrings`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
