Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "opus/opus.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int channels = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>() % 3 + 1;
  const int frame_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>() % 1920 + 1;
  float* pcm = new float[channels * frame_size];
  for (int i = 0; i < channels * frame_size; ++i) {
    pcm[i] = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<float>();
  }
  OpusProjectionEncoder* st = opus_projection_encoder_create(
      48000, channels, OPUS_APPLICATION_VOIP, nullptr);
  if (st == nullptr) {
    delete[] pcm;
    return 0;
  }
  const int max_data_bytes = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024);
  char* data = new char[max_data_bytes];
  int ret = opus_projection_encode_float(st, pcm, frame_size, data,
                                         max_data_bytes);
  delete[] pcm;
  delete[] data;
  opus_projection_encoder_destroy(st);
  return 0;
}
```
The following changes were made to the code:

1. The fourth argument to `opus_projection_encoder_create` was changed from `&stream` to `nullptr`.
2. The `#include` directive for `opus.h` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because `opus.h` is a C header file, and the C++ compiler needs to know that it should be compiled as C code.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
