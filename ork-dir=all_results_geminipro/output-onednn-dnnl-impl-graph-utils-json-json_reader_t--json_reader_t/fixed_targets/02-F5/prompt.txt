Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "json.hpp"

extern "C" {
#include "dnnl.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  char *fuzz_filename = "/tmp/fuzz.json";
  std::ofstream(fuzz_filename, std::ios::binary).write(input.c_str(), size);

  std::ifstream fs(fuzz_filename);
  dnnl::impl::graph::utils::json::json_reader_t read(&fs);
  try {
    read.~json_reader_t();
  } catch (...) {
  }

  // Add the code to delete the temporary file
  remove(fuzz_filename);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Includes the necessary header file `<unistd.h>` for the `remove` function.
2. Adds the `remove` function call to delete the temporary file `/tmp/fuzz.json` after it is no longer needed.

This ensures that the file is properly cleaned up and does not cause any issues with subsequent fuzzing runs.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
