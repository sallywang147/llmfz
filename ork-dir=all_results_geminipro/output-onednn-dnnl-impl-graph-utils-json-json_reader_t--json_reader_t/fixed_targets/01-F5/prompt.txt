Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "json.hpp"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  char *fuzz_filename = "/tmp/fuzz.json";
  std::ofstream(fuzz_filename, std::ios::binary).write(input.c_str(), size);

  std::ifstream fs(fuzz_filename);
  dnnl::impl::graph::utils::json::json_reader_t read(&fs);
  dnnl::impl::graph::utils::json::json_reader_t *ptr = &read;
  delete ptr;
  // Call the destructor explicitly.
  read.~json_reader_t();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `dnnl` library is not included.
2. The `json.hpp` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

The fixed code includes the `dnnl` library and wraps the `json.hpp` header with `extern "C" {}`. This allows the code to be compiled and linked successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
