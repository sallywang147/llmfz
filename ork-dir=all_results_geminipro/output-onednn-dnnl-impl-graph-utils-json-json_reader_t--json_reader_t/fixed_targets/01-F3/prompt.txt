Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "json.hpp"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);

  char *fuzz_filename = "/tmp/fuzz.json";
  std::ofstream(fuzz_filename, std::ios::binary).write(input.c_str(), size);

  std::ifstream fs(fuzz_filename);
  dnnl::impl::graph::utils::json::json_reader_t read(&fs);
  dnnl::impl::graph::utils::json::json_reader_t *ptr = &read;
  delete ptr;
  // Call the destructor explicitly.
  read.~json_reader_t();

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `json.hpp` header was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `json_reader_t` class, which is used in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

To fix the issue, the `#include "json.hpp"` line has been wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the linker to look for the definition of the `json_reader_t` class in the C++ standard library, rather than in the `json.hpp` header.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
