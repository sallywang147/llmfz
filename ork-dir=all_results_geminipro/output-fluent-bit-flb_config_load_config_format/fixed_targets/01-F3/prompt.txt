Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "flb_config.h"
#include "flb_cf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct flb_config config;
  struct flb_cf cf;

  std::string config_string = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  flb_config_init(&config);
  int ret = flb_config_load_config_format(&config, &cf, config_string.c_str());
  flb_config_destroy(&config);
  return ret;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary header files (`flb_config.h` and `flb_cf.h`) and wraps the `#include` directives for these header files with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the linker can find the definitions of the functions that are declared in these header files.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
