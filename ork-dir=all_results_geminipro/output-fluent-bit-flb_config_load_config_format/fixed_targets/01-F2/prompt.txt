Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flb.h"

extern "C" {
#include "flb_config.h"
#include "flb_cf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct flb_config config;
  struct flb_cf cf;

  std::string config_string = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  flb_config_init(&config);
  int ret = flb_config_load_config_format(&config, &cf, config_string.c_str());
  flb_config_destroy(&config);
  return ret;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'flb_config_init'
error: undefined reference to 'flb_config_load_config_format'
error: undefined reference to 'flb_config_destroy'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of these functions. The reason is that the header files that declare these functions are not included in the source file.

To fix this, we need to include the header files that declare these functions. In this case, we need to include the following header files:

* `flb_config.h`
* `flb_cf.h`

We also need to wrap the `#include` directives for these header files with `extern "C" {}`. This is because these header files are written in C, and we are compiling our code with a C++ compiler.

Once we have made these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
