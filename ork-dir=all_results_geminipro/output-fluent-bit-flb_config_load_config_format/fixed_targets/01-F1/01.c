The error message is:

```

error: undefined reference to 'flb_config_load_config_format'
error: undefined reference to 'flb_config_destroy'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of these functions. The reason is that the header files that declare these functions are not included in the source file.

To fix this, we need to include the header files that declare these functions. In this case, we need to include the following header files:

* `flb_config.h`
* `flb_cf.h`

We also need to wrap the `#include` directives for these header files with `extern "C" {}`. This is because these header files are written in C, and we are compiling our code with a C++ compiler.

Once we have made these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
