Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <coap3/coap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <coap3/coap_debug.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct coap_address_t addr;
  coap_address_init(&addr);

  struct coap_context_t *ctx = coap_new_context(&addr);
  if (ctx) {
    coap_free_context(ctx); // Corrected the function name from 'coap_delete_context' to 'coap_free_context'
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a build error because `coap_delete_context` is not a function in the coap library. The correct function to use is `coap_free_context`.

The corrected code uses `coap_free_context` instead of `coap_delete_context` to free the coap context. This should resolve the build error and allow the code to compile successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
