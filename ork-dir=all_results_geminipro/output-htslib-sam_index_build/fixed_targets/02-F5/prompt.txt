Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <config.h>

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include "../../hts/sam.h"

extern "C" {
#include "../../hts/hts.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  samFile *in;
  bam_hdr_t *h;
  char *fn;
  int min_shift = 0;

  if (size < 4) return 0;  /* need space for a SAM header */

  fn = strdup("/dev/shm/test.bam");
  in = sam_open(fn, "wb");
  if (in == 0) {
    perror(fn);
    return 1;
  }
  h = sam_hdr_read(in);
  sam_close(in);

  sam_index_build2(fn, min_shift, 0);  // Use sam_index_build2 instead of sam_index_build

  sam_hdr_destroy(h);
  free(fn);

  return 0;
}
```
In this code, the `sam_index_build` function is replaced with `sam_index_build2` to fix the build error. The `sam_index_build2` function takes an additional parameter, `n_threads`, which specifies the number of threads to use for indexing. In this case, `n_threads` is set to 0, which means that the default number of threads will be used.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
