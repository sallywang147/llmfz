Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <brotli/decode.h>
}

// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  BrotliDecoderState *state = BrotliDecoderCreateInstance(0, 0, 0);
  if (!state) {
    // OOM is out-of-scope here.
    return 0;
  }

  size_t dictionary_size = 0;  // Initialize to 0
  if (size > 0) {
    dictionary_size = data[size - 1] & 7;
  }
  if (dictionary_size > 0) {
    BrotliDecoderAttachDictionary(state, 0, dictionary_size, (const char *)data);
  }

  BrotliDecoderDestroyInstance(state);
  return 0;
}
```
Changes made:

1. Initialized `dictionary_size` to 0 to avoid uninitialized variable errors.
2. Added `const` to the `(char *)data` cast to match the `BrotliDecoderAttachDictionary` function signature.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
