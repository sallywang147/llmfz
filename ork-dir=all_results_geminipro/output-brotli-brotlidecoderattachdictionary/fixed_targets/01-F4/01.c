The code above has been modified to fix the build errors. The following changes were made:

1. The `#include` directive for `<brotli/decode.h>` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to resolve the "undefined reference to" errors.
2. The `std::vector` class was added to the `#include` directives to resolve the "undefined reference to" errors.
