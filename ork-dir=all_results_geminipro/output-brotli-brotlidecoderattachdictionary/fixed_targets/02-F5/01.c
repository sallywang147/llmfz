```

The issue in the code is that the `BrotliDecoderAttachDictionary` function expects a `const char*` as the fourth argument, but the code was passing a `char*`. This mismatch in types caused the build error.

To fix the issue, the code was updated to cast the `data` pointer to `const char*` before passing it to the `BrotliDecoderAttachDictionary` function. This ensures that the function receives the correct type of argument and allows the code to build successfully.
