Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string schema = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  flatbuffers::Parser parser;
  std::string error_message;
  std::string text_file;
  char* result = flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile(&parser, schema.c_str(), &text_file, &error_message);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code, the following changes were made:

1. The `schema` variable is now a `std::string`, and the `schema.c_str()` method is used to pass the schema as a C-style string to the `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function. This is necessary because the `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function expects a C-style string as its second argument.

2. The `error_message` and `text_file` variables are now passed by reference to the `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function. This is necessary because the `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function may modify these variables.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
