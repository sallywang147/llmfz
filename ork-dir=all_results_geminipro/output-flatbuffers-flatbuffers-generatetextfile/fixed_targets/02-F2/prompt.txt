Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  flatbuffers::Parser parser;
  std::string text_output;
  std::string binary_output;
  char* result = flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile(&parser, input.data(), input.size(), &text_output);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function takes a `const char*` as the second argument, but the code passes a `std::string` object. This can be fixed by calling `input.data()` to get a pointer to the underlying C-style string.
2. The `flatbuffers::GenerateTextFile` function also takes a `size_t` as the third argument, but the code passes a `std::string::size_type`. This can be fixed by calling `input.size()` to get the size of the string.

The corrected code above fixes these issues and should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
