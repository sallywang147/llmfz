Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "proton/pn_transport.h"

extern "C" {
#include "proton/pn_transport.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  pn_transport_t *transport =
      static_cast<pn_transport_t *>(malloc(sizeof(pn_transport_t)));
  if (transport == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  pni_post_sasl_frame(transport);
  free(transport);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to `pni_post_sasl_frame'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `pni_post_sasl_frame`. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for the header that contains the definition of `pni_post_sasl_frame` with `extern "C" {}`. In this case, the header is `proton/pn_transport.h`, so we need to add the following lines to the beginning of the file:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include "proton/pn_transport.h"
}
```

This will tell the linker to look for the definition of `pni_post_sasl_frame` in a C-style header file, which is what the Proton library provides.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
