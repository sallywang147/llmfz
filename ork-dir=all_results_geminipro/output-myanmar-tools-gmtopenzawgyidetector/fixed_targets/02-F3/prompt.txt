Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "myanmartools.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libmyanmar.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *rawData, size_t length) {
  auto data = reinterpret_cast<const char *>(rawData);
  struct GMTZawgyiDetector *detector = GMTOpenZawgyiDetector();
  if (detector == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  GMTZawgyiDetectorDetect(detector, data, length);
  GMTCloseZawgyiDetector(detector);
  return 0; // Non-zero return values are reserved for future use.
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include "myanmartools.h"` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions declared in this header.
2. The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is required for the linker to find it.

The fixed code addresses both of these issues by wrapping the `#include "myanmartools.h"` header with `extern "C" {}` and declaring the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function as `extern "C"`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
