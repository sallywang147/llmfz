Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "usbredirparser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct usbredirparser* parser =
      usbredirparser_new(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  if (parser == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  usbredirparser_send_filter_reject(parser);
  usbredirparser_delete(parser);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `usbredirparser.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause linking errors when compiling the code.
2. The `usbredirparser_new`, `usbredirparser_send_filter_reject`, and `usbredirparser_delete` functions are not declared as `extern "C"`. This can also cause linking errors.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The `usbredirparser.h` header is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `usbredirparser_new`, `usbredirparser_send_filter_reject`, and `usbredirparser_delete` functions are now declared as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
