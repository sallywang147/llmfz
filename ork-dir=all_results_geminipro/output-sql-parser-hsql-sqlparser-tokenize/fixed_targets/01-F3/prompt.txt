Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#include "SQLParser.h"
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  std::vector<SQLToken> tokens;
  SQLParser::tokenize(input, &tokens);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `SQLParser.h` header file is not included with the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can cause issues with linking the object files, as the C++ compiler may not be able to find the necessary symbols.
2. The `using namespace hsql;` statement is not wrapped with the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can also cause issues with linking, as the C++ compiler may not be able to find the necessary symbols.

To fix these issues, the `SQLParser.h` header file and the `using namespace hsql;` statement should be wrapped with the `extern "C"` wrapper.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#include "SQLParser.h"
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

extern "C" {
using namespace hsql;
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  std::vector<SQLToken> tokens;
  SQLParser::tokenize(input, &tokens);
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and link successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
