The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "SQLParser.h"
}

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  std::vector<SQLToken> tokens;
  SQLParser::tokenize(input, &tokens);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `SQLParser` class is declared in the `hsql` namespace, but the `using namespace hsql;` statement is missing. This means that the `SQLParser::tokenize` function is not visible to the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
2. The `SQLParser.h` header file is not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This means that the `SQLParser` class is not visible to the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is declared as a C function.

The corrected code fixes these issues by adding the `using namespace hsql;` statement and wrapping the `SQLParser.h` header file in `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the `SQLParser` class is visible to the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

With these changes, the code should build successfully.
