Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "oc_state.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct oc_theora_state state;
  size_t fragi = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  int pli = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int last_zzi = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  short dc_quant = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();
  const size_t dct_coeffs_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<short> dct_coeffs(dct_coeffs_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes<short>(dct_coeffs.data(), dct_coeffs_size);

  oc_state_frag_recon_c(&state, fragi, pli, dct_coeffs.data(), last_zzi,
                        dc_quant);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `oc_state.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file is written in C and the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is written in C++.
2. The function `oc_state_frag_recon_c` is not declared in the header file `oc_state.h`. This means that the compiler does not know about the function and cannot generate code for it.

To fix the code, we need to wrap the header file `oc_state.h` with `extern "C" {}` and declare the function `oc_state_frag_recon_c` in the header file.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
