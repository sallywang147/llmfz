Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "libtsm.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libFuzzer.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct tsm_symbol_table *tbl = tsm_symbol_table_new();
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  int sym = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int ucs4 = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  int ret = tsm_symbol_append(tbl, sym, ucs4);
  tsm_symbol_table_unref(tbl);
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `#include "libtsm.h"` is missing. This header is necessary for the code to compile and link with the `libtsm` library.
2. The header `#include "libFuzzer.h"` is missing. This header is necessary for the code to compile and link with the `libFuzzer` library.
3. The function `tsm_symbol_table_new()` is missing. This function is necessary to create a new symbol table.
4. The function `tsm_symbol_append()` is missing. This function is necessary to add a new symbol to the symbol table.
5. The function `tsm_symbol_table_unref()` is missing. This function is necessary to free the memory allocated for the symbol table.

The fixed code includes the necessary headers and functions, and it compiles and links successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
