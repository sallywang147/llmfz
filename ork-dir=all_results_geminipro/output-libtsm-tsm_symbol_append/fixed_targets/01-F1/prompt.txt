Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libtsm.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct tsm_symbol_table *tbl = tsm_symbol_table_new();
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  while (stream.remaining_bytes() > 0) {
    int sym = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
    int ucs4 = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
    tsm_symbol_append(tbl, sym, ucs4);
  }
  tsm_symbol_table_free(tbl);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
