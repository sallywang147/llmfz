The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'tsm_symbol_append'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `tsm_symbol_append`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library containing this function is linked with our program.

In this case, the library is `libtsm.h`. We can link it with our program by adding the following line to the top of our program:

```
#include <tsm.h>
```

Here is the corrected code:

```
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "libtsm.h"
#include "tsm.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libFuzzer.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct tsm_symbol_table *tbl = tsm_symbol_table_new();
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  int sym = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int ucs4 = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  int ret = tsm_symbol_append(tbl, sym, ucs4);
  tsm_symbol_table_unref(tbl);
  return ret;
}
```

With this change, the program should build and run successfully.
