Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

extern "C" {
#include "muParser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string line_string((char *)data, size);
  try {
    mu::Parser parser;
    parser.SetExpr(line_string);
    double d;
    parser.Eval(&d);
  } catch (mu::Parser::exception_type &e) {
    // Ignore the exception.
  } catch (mu::ParserError &e) {
    // Ignore the exception.
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had two issues:

1. The `muParser.h` header file was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to complain about undefined references to the functions and variables defined in `muParser.h`.
2. The `mu::Parser::exception_type` and `mu::ParserError` exceptions were not caught. This caused the program to crash when an exception was thrown.

The fixed code wraps the `muParser.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and catches the exceptions thrown by the `mu::Parser` object. This allows the program to compile and run without crashing.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
