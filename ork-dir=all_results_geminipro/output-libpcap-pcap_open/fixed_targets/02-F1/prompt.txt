Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <pcap.h>

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  if (Size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  char *source = (char *)malloc(Size);
  memcpy(source, Data, Size);
  source[Size - 1] = '\0';
  char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
  pcap_t *handle = pcap_open(source, 65535, PCAP_OPENFLAG_PROMISCUOUS, 1000, NULL, errbuf);
  if (handle == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "pcap_open: %s\n", errbuf);
    return 0;
  }
  pcap_close(handle);
  free(source);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
