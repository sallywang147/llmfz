Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

#include "simdutf/internal/detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use.h"

extern "C" {
#include "simdutf/public.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  simdutf::internal::detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use
      detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use;
  simdutf::internal::unsupported_implementation unsupported_implementation;

  detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use
      .required_instruction_sets(&unsupported_implementation);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `simdutf/public.h` header is missing. This header is necessary for using the `simdutf` library.
2. The `detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use` and `unsupported_implementation` variables are declared as `simdutf::internal` types, but the `simdutf/public.h` header only exposes the public API.

To fix these issues, we can wrap the `#include "simdutf/public.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` to make the header compatible with C++ code. We can also change the types of the `detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use` and `unsupported_implementation` variables to `simdutf::public` types.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
