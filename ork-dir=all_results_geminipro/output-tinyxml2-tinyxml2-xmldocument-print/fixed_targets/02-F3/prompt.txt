Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code is a complete and correct implementation of the LibFuzzer entry point function for a tinyxml2-based fuzzer. It includes the necessary headers, defines the function signature correctly, and uses the tinyxml2 library to parse and print XML documents.

Therefore, there is no need to fix the code. The build error message is likely caused by an issue in the build environment or the compiler settings.

To troubleshoot the build error, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that you have installed the tinyxml2 library correctly and that the header files and libraries are in the correct locations.
2. Check your compiler settings to ensure that the correct compiler flags and include paths are being used.
3. Try rebuilding the project with a different compiler or version of the compiler.

If you are still encountering build issues, please provide the complete error message so that I can help you identify and fix the problem.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void tinyxml2::XMLDocument::Print(tinyxml2::XMLPrinter*) const` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void tinyxml2::XMLDocument::Print(tinyxml2::XMLPrinter*) const` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
