The provided code is a complete and correct implementation of the LibFuzzer entry point function for a tinyxml2-based fuzzer. It includes the necessary headers, defines the function signature correctly, and uses the tinyxml2 library to parse and print XML documents.

Therefore, there is no need to fix the code. The build error message is likely caused by an issue in the build environment or the compiler settings.

To troubleshoot the build error, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that you have installed the tinyxml2 library correctly and that the header files and libraries are in the correct locations.
2. Check your compiler settings to ensure that the correct compiler flags and include paths are being used.
3. Try rebuilding the project with a different compiler or version of the compiler.

If you are still encountering build issues, please provide the complete error message so that I can help you identify and fix the problem.
