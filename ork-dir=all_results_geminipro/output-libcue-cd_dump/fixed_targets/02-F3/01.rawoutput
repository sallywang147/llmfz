```c++
#include "libcue.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "libcue.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Cd cd;
  if (cd_parse(&cd, data, size) == 0) {
    cd_dump(&cd);
  }
  cd_free(&cd);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

- Added `cd_free(&cd);` to free the allocated memory for the `Cd` struct after it is no longer needed. This is important to prevent memory leaks.

- Wrapped the `#include "libcue.h"` directive inside an `extern "C" {}` block. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names in the `libcue.h` header, which would prevent the linker from finding the definitions of those functions.
