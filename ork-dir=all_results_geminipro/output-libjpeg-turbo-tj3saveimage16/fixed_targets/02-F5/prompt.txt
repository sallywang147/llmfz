Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The issue is that the `tj3SaveImage16` function is not declared in the `turbojpeg.h` header file. To fix this, we need to include the `turbojpeg.h` header file with the `extern "C"` directive, which tells the compiler to use the C calling convention for the function.

The corrected code:
```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <turbojpeg.h>
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  tjhandle handle = NULL;
  char *filename = NULL;
  short *buffer = NULL;
  int width = 0, height = 0, pitch = 0, pixelFormat = 0;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  if ((handle = tjInitTransform()) == NULL)
    goto bailout;

  filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  width = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  height = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  pitch = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  pixelFormat = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 15);
  buffer = (short *)malloc(width * height * 2);
  if (!buffer)
    goto bailout;

  tj3SaveImage16(handle, filename, buffer, width, pitch, height, pixelFormat);

  free(buffer);
  buffer = NULL;

bailout:
  if (handle)
    tjDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
