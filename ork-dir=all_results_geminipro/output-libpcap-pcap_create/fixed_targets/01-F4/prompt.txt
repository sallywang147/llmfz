Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <pcap.h>

extern "C" {
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  size_t device_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto device = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(device_size);
  size_t errbuf_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  auto errbuf = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(errbuf_size);

  char *device_name = device.data();
  char *errbuf_name = errbuf.data();
  pcap_t *handle = pcap_create(device_name, errbuf_name);

  if (handle == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "pcap_create() failed: %s\n", errbuf_name);
    return 1;
  }

  pcap_close(handle);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:
1. The error message indicates that `pcap_create` is not defined. This is because the header file `pcap/pcap.h` is not included. To fix this, we need to include this header file.
2. The header file `pcap/pcap.h` is not a C++ header file, so we need to wrap it with `extern "C" {}` to make it compatible with C++.

The fixed code includes the necessary header file and wraps it with `extern "C" {}`. This should fix the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
