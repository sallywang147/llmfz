Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "simdutf/internal/detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use.h"

extern "C" {
#include "simdutf/public.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  simdutf::internal::unsupported_implementation impl;
  (void)impl.name(&impl);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the necessary header files to use the `simdutf` library. To fix this, the following headers were included:

- `<fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>`: This header file is necessary to use the `FuzzedDataProvider` class.
- `<cstddef>`: This header file is necessary to use the `size_t` type.
- `<cstdint>`: This header file is necessary to use the `uint8_t` type.
- `<cstdlib>`: This header file is necessary to use the `exit()` function.
- `<string>`: This header file is necessary to use the `std::string` type.
- `simdutf/internal/detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use.h`: This header file is necessary to use the `simdutf::internal::detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use()` function.
- `simdutf/public.h`: This header file is necessary to use the `simdutf` library.

Additionally, the `extern "C" {}` block was added around the `#include` directive for `simdutf/public.h`. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the symbols in the header file, which would prevent the linker from finding them.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
