Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "simdutf/internal/detect_best_supported_implementation_on_first_use.h"
#include "simdutf/internal/unsupported_implementation.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  simdutf::internal::unsupported_implementation obj;
  const std::string *result = obj.name(&obj);
  delete result;
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the provided code is that the `result` variable is of type `std::string*`, but the `delete` operator is used on it. This is incorrect because `delete` is only meant to be used on pointers to dynamically allocated objects. In this case, `result` is a pointer to a string literal, which is stored in the program's read-only memory. Attempting to delete it will result in a runtime error.

To fix this, the type of `result` should be changed to `const std::string*`. This will prevent the `delete` operator from being used on it, and the program will run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
