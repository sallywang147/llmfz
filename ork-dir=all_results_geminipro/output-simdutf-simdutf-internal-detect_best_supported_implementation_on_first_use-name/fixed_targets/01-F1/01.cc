The issue in the provided code is that the `result` variable is of type `std::string*`, but the `delete` operator is used on it. This is incorrect because `delete` is only meant to be used on pointers to dynamically allocated objects. In this case, `result` is a pointer to a string literal, which is stored in the program's read-only memory. Attempting to delete it will result in a runtime error.

To fix this, the type of `result` should be changed to `const std::string*`. This will prevent the `delete` operator from being used on it, and the program will run correctly.
