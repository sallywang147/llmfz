Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "wget.h"
#include "wget_tcp.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct wget_tcp_st tcp;
  wget_tcp_init(&tcp);

  const std::string format = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const char* format_c_str = format.c_str();

  va_list args;
  va_start(args, format_c_str);
  wget_tcp_vprintf(&tcp, const_cast<char*>(format_c_str), args);
  va_end(args);

  wget_tcp_close(&tcp);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `va_start` and `va_end` functions are not declared in the global scope.
2. The `wget_tcp_vprintf` function is not declared in the global scope.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. The `va_start` and `va_end` functions were declared in the global scope.
2. The `wget_tcp_vprintf` function was declared in the global scope.

The fixed code should now compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
