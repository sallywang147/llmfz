Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "wget.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string fmt = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  struct wget_tcp_st tcp;
  wget_tcp_init(&tcp);

  // Initialize va_list.
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, fmt.c_str());

  wget_tcp_vprintf(&tcp, const_cast<char*>(fmt.c_str()), &args);

  va_end(args);
  wget_tcp_close(&tcp);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build issue because the header file `wget.h` is included without the `extern "C"` directive. This directive is necessary for the linker to find the definitions of the functions in the header file, which are declared using the C calling convention.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `wget.h` with `extern "C"`. This tells the compiler to use the C calling convention for the functions in the header file, which allows the linker to find their definitions.

The corrected code is shown above. With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
