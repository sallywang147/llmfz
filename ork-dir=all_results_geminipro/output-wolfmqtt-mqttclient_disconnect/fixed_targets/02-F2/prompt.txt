Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "mqtt_client.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mqtt_client.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  MqttClient_Init(&client, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str(),
                   stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>());
  MqttClient_Connect(&client, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str(),
                     stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>(),
                     stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>());
  MqttClient_Disconnect(&client);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the code is that the header `mqtt_client.h` is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This causes a conflict between the C and C++ versions of the header, resulting in the linker error.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for `mqtt_client.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the header is included in the C++ file as a C header, which resolves the conflict and allows the code to compile and link successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
