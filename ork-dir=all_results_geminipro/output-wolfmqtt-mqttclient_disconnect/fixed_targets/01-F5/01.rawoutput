```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "mqtt_client.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  MqttClient_Init(&client, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  MqttClient_Connect(&client, "localhost", 1883, 1000);
  MqttClient_Disconnect(&client);
  MqttClient_Destroy(&client);  // Add this line to destroy the client.
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include "mqtt_client.h"` directive. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the function names in the header file, which would cause the linker to be unable to find the definitions of the functions.

2. Added `MqttClient_Destroy(&client);` before the `return 0;` statement. This is necessary to properly clean up the MQTT client and free any resources that it may have allocated.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
