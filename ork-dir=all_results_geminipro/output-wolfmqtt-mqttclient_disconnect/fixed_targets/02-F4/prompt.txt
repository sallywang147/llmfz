Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "mqtt_client.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct _MqttClient client;
  MqttClient_Init(&client, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str(),
                   stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>());
  MqttClient_Connect(&client, stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str(),
                     stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint16_t>(),
                     stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint32_t>());
  MqttClient_Disconnect(&client);
  MqttClient_Destroy(&client);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that it does not call `MqttClient_Destroy` to free the resources allocated by `MqttClient_Init`. This can lead to memory leaks and other problems.

To fix this, we have added a call to `MqttClient_Destroy` at the end of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. This will ensure that the resources allocated by `MqttClient_Init` are properly freed before the function returns.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
