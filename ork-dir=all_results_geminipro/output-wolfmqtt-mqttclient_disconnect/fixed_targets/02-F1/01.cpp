The issue with the code is that the header `mqtt_client.h` is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This causes a conflict between the C and C++ versions of the header, resulting in the linker error.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directive for `mqtt_client.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the header is included in the C++ file as a C header, which resolves the conflict and allows the code to compile and link successfully.
