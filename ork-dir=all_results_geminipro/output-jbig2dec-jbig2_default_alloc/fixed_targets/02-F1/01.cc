```

The original code has an issue with the header file `jbig2.h`. The error message suggests that the compiler cannot find the definition of `jbig2_default_alloc`. This is because the header file `jbig2.h` is not properly included in the code.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `jbig2.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is because `jbig2.h` is a C header file, and it needs to be included in a C++ program using the `extern "C"` directive.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for `jbig2.h` is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, and the compiler should be able to find the definition of `jbig2_default_alloc`.
