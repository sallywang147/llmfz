Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include "jbig2.h"

extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t alloc_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  void *ptr = jbig2_default_alloc(NULL, alloc_size);
  if (ptr) {
    jbig2_free(ptr);  // Free the allocated memory before returning
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `jbig2_default_alloc` function returns a pointer to the allocated memory, but the code didn't store this pointer anywhere. This could lead to memory leaks.
2. The `jbig2_free` function was called with a `NULL` argument, which is undefined behavior.

The fixed code addresses these issues by:

1. Storing the pointer returned by `jbig2_default_alloc` in a variable called `ptr`.
2. Calling `jbig2_free` with the `ptr` variable as the argument, ensuring that the allocated memory is properly freed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
