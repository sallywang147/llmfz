Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "jbig2.h"

extern "C" {
#include "jbig2.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  Jbig2Allocator allocator;

  allocator.alloc = jbig2_default_alloc;
  allocator.free = free;
  allocator.realloc = realloc;

  jbig2_default_alloc(&allocator, size);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an issue with the header file `jbig2.h`. The error message suggests that the compiler cannot find the definition of `jbig2_default_alloc`. This is because the header file `jbig2.h` is not properly included in the code.

To fix this issue, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `jbig2.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is because `jbig2.h` is a C header file, and it needs to be included in a C++ program using the `extern "C"` directive.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for `jbig2.h` is now wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, and the compiler should be able to find the definition of `jbig2_default_alloc`.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
