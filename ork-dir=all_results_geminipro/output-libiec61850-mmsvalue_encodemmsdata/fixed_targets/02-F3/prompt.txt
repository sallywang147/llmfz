Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "hal_thread.h"
#include "iec61850_server.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mms_value.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const char *data, size_t size) {
  int out;
  MmsValue *value = NULL;
  value = MmsValue_decodeMmsData(data, 0, size, &out);

  if (value != NULL) {
    char *buffer = new char[1024];
    MmsValue_encodeMmsData(value, buffer, 0, true);
    delete[] buffer;

    MmsValue_delete(value);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The header file `mms_value.h` was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definitions of the functions declared in that header file.
* The `MmsValue_delete` function was not declared in the header file `mms_value.h`. This caused the compiler to generate an error when trying to call that function.

To fix the code, we wrapped the `#include` directive for `mms_value.h` with `extern "C" {}` and added a declaration for the `MmsValue_delete` function to the `mms_value.h` header file.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
