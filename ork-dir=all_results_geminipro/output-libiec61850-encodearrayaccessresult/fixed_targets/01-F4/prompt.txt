Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "hal_thread.h"
#include "iec61850_server.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const char *data, size_t size) {
  int out;
  MmsValue *value = NULL;
  value = MmsValue_decodeMmsData(data, 0, size, &out);

  if (value != NULL) {
    char buffer[1024];
    int bufPos = 0;
    int encode = 0;
    encodeArrayAccessResult(value, buffer, bufPos, encode);
    MmsValue_delete(value);
  }

  return 0;
}

int main() {
  // Initialize the IEC 61850 server.
  iec61850_server_init();

  // Start the IEC 61850 server thread.
  hal_thread_create(&iec61850_server_thread, iec61850_server_run, NULL);

  // Wait for the IEC 61850 server thread to finish.
  hal_thread_join(iec61850_server_thread);

  // Clean up the IEC 61850 server.
  iec61850_server_cleanup();

  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `MmsValue_decodeMmsData'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `MmsValue_decodeMmsData`. This function is declared in the header file `iec61850_server.h`, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are being linked.

To fix this error, you need to add the source file that defines the function `MmsValue_decodeMmsData` to the build. This source file is typically called `iec61850_server.c`.

Once you have added the source file to the build, the linker will be able to find the definition of the function `MmsValue_decodeMmsData` and the error will be resolved.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
