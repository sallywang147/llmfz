Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "muduo/base/TimeZone.h"

extern "C" {
#include "muduo/base/TimeZone.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  muduo::TimeZone tz;
  tz.loadZoneFile(new_str);
  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an issue with the `#include` directive for the `muduo/base/TimeZone.h` header. It is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can cause linker errors or undefined reference errors. To fix this, we need to remove the duplicate `#include` directive and wrap the `#include` directive for the `muduo/base/TimeZone.h` header with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code is shown above. The `#include` directive for the `muduo/base/TimeZone.h` header is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, and the duplicate `#include` directive is removed. This should fix the linker errors or undefined reference errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
