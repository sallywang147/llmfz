Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include "opentype-sanitiser.h"
#include "ots-memory-stream.h"
#include "ots.h"

namespace ots {

struct SILSub {
  void SILSub(SILSub *other) { this->SILSub(other); }
};

class OpenTypeSILF {
 public:
  OpenTypeSILF() {}
  bool Parse(const uint8_t *data, size_t length) {
    ots::ExpandingMemoryStream stream(length /*initial*/, length * 8 /*limit*/);
    stream.WriteRaw(data, length);
    stream.Seek(0);
    bool ok = ots::OpenTypeSILF::Deserialize(&stream, this);
    return ok;
  }

  std::vector<SILSub> subs;

 private:
  std::vector<uint8_t> data_;
};

}  // namespace ots

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ots::OpenTypeSILF silf;
  if (!silf.Parse(data, size)) {
    return 0;
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < silf.subs.size(); ++i) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < silf.subs.size(); ++j) {
      silf.subs[i].SILSub(&silf.subs[j]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
The original code has a few issues:

1. The `SILSub` struct has a constructor with the same name as the struct, which is not allowed in C++.
2. The `OpenTypeSILF` class has a private member variable `data_`, which is not used anywhere in the code.
3. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is not declared as `extern "C"`, which is necessary for it to be visible to the C++ compiler.

The fixed code addresses these issues:

1. The `SILSub` struct constructor is renamed to `SILSub`.
2. The `data_` member variable is removed from the `OpenTypeSILF` class.
3. The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as `extern "C"`, which makes it visible to the C++ compiler.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
