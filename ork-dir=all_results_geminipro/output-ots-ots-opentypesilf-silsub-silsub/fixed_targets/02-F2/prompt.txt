Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "opentype-sanitiser.h"
#include "ots.h"

namespace {

class SILSub : public ots::OpenTypeSILF::SILSub {
 public:
  SILSub() {}
  ~SILSub() {}

  bool Parse(ots::Buffer *buf, ots::OpenTypeFile *font) override {
    return true;
  }
  bool Serialize(ots::Buffer *buf, ots::OpenTypeFile *font) override {
    return true;
  }
};

}  // namespace

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  SILSub sub;
  ots::Buffer buf(data, size);
  sub.Parse(&buf, nullptr);
  sub.Serialize(&buf, nullptr);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue is that the `ots::Buffer` and `ots::OpenTypeFile` classes are defined in the `ots` namespace, but the `Parse` and `Serialize` methods of the `SILSub` class are declared to take `ots::Buffer*` and `ots::OpenTypeFile*` arguments without the `ots` namespace. This causes a compiler error because the compiler cannot find the `ots::Buffer` and `ots::OpenTypeFile` classes in the global namespace.

To fix the issue, the `ots` namespace needs to be added to the `Parse` and `Serialize` method declarations in the `SILSub` class. This can be done by adding the following line to the top of the `SILSub` class declaration:

```c++
using namespace ots;
```

This line tells the compiler to look in the `ots` namespace for the `Buffer` and `OpenTypeFile` classes when resolving the `Parse` and `Serialize` method declarations.

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
