Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STBI_ONLY_JPEG
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int x, y, channels;
  unsigned char *img = stbi_load_from_memory(data, size, &x, &y, &channels, 4);
  free(img);
  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `char * load_jpeg_image(struct stbi__jpeg * z, int * out_x, int * out_y, int * comp, int req_comp)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `char * load_jpeg_image(struct stbi__jpeg * z, int * out_x, int * out_y, int * comp, int req_comp)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
