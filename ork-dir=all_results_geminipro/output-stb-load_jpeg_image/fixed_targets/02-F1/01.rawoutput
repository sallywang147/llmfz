```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int x, y, channels;
  unsigned char *img = stbi_load_from_memory(data, size, &x, &y, &channels, 4);
  free(img);
  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The code was fixed by making the following changes:

* The `load_jpeg_image` function was replaced with `stbi_load_from_memory` which is the correct function to load an image from memory using the stb_image library.
* The `char *img` variable was changed to `unsigned char *img` to match the return type of `stbi_load_from_memory`.
