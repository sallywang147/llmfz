Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../stb_image.h"

unsigned char *load_jpeg_image(const char *filename, int *x, int *y, int *channels, int desired_channels) {
  int n;
  unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, x, y, &n, desired_channels);
  *channels = n;
  return data;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int x, y, channels;

  if (!stbi_info_from_memory(data, size, &x, &y, &channels))
    return 0;

  /* exit if the image is larger than ~80MB */
  if (y && x > (80000000 / 4) / y)
    return 0;

  unsigned char *img = load_jpeg_image(NULL, &x, &y, &channels, 4);

  free(img);

  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
