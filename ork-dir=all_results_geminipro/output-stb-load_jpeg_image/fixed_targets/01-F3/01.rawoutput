The issue in the original code was that `load_jpeg_image` was returning `NULL` when the image was not found. This caused `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to crash when trying to free the `img` pointer.

To fix this, we added a check in `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` to see if `img` is `NULL` before trying to free it. If `img` is `NULL`, we return 0 to indicate that the input is invalid.
