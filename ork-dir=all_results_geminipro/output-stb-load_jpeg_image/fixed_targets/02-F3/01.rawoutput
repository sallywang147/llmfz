```c++
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#define STBI_ONLY_JPEG
#include "../stb_image.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int x, y, channels;
  unsigned char *img = stbi_load_from_memory(data, size, &x, &y, &channels, 4);
  free(img);
  return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

The issue in the original code is that the function `stbi_load_from_memory` is not defined in the `stb_image.h` header file. This is because the header file only includes the declaration of the function, but not its definition. To fix this, we need to include the definition of the function by defining the macro `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` before including the header file.

Additionally, we need to define the macro `STBI_ONLY_JPEG` to only include the JPEG support in the library, as the fuzzer only needs to load JPEG images. This will reduce the size of the compiled code.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
