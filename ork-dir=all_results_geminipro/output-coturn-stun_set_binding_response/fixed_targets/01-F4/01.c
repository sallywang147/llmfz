The original code has an issue with the `stun_set_binding_response` function. This function is declared in the `stun_client.h` header file, which is included in the code. However, the linker is unable to find the definition of this function, resulting in the build error.

To fix this issue, make sure that the `stun_client.c` file, which contains the definition of the `stun_set_binding_response` function, is compiled and linked with the rest of the code. You can do this by adding the `stun_client.c` file to the build process or by including the object file generated from `stun_client.c` in the linking stage.

Once you have added the `stun_client.c` file to the build process, the linker should be able to find the definition of the `stun_set_binding_response` function and the build error should be resolved.
