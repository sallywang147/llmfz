Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "proto.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string proto_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct proto_info pi;
  pi.name = const_cast<char*>(proto_name.c_str());
  proto_tcp_init(&pi);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code contains the following issues:

1. The `proto.h` header file is not included. This header file is necessary for the `proto_tcp_init` function to be defined.
2. The `proto_info` structure is not defined. This structure is necessary for the `proto_tcp_init` function to be called.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The `proto.h` header file has been included.
2. The `proto_info` structure has been defined.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
