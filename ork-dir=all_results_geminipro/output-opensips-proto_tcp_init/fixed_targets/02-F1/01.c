```

The original code contains the following issues:

1. The `proto.h` header file is not included. This header file is necessary for the `proto_tcp_init` function to be defined.
2. The `proto_info` structure is not defined. This structure is necessary for the `proto_tcp_init` function to be called.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The `proto.h` header file has been included.
2. The `proto_info` structure has been defined.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.
