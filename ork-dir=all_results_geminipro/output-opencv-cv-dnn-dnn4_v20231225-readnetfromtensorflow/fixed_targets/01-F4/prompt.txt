Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstddef>
#include <vector>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <opencv2/dnn.hpp>

extern "C" {
#include <opencv2/dnn/dnn4_v20231225.hpp>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzz_provider(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> model_data = fuzz_provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  std::vector<uint8_t> config_data = fuzz_provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes();

  cv::dnn::Net net;
  cv::dnn::dnn4_v20231225::readNetFromTensorflow(net, model_data, config_data);

  return 0;
}
```
In the original code, the function `cv::dnn::dnn4_v20231225::readNetFromTensorflow` is used, but it is not declared in the header file `<opencv2/dnn.hpp>`. To fix this, the function declaration is added to the header file `<opencv2/dnn/dnn4_v20231225.hpp>`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
