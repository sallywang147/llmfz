Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to '_scan_entity'
```
This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `_scan_entity`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the definition of `_scan_entity` is included in the build.

One way to do this is to add the following line to the top of the file:

```
extern "C" int _scan_entity(const char* input);
```

This will tell the linker that the definition of `_scan_entity` is in another file, and it should look for it there.

Another way to fix this is to move the definition of `_scan_entity` into the same file as the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. This can be done by adding the following code to the bottom of the file:

```
int _scan_entity(const char* input) {
  // Implementation of _scan_entity
}
```

Once you have made one of these changes, the code should build and run without errors.

Here is the complete fixed code:

```
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "scan_entity.h"
}

extern "C" int _scan_entity(const char* input);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t input_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* input = new char[input_size + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(input, input_size);
  input[input_size] = '\0';

  int result = _scan_entity(input);

  delete[] input;
  return result;
}

int _scan_entity(const char* input) {
  // Implementation of _scan_entity
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
