```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "htmlparser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "scanentities.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *copy = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(copy, data, size);
  copy[size] = '\0';

  _scan_entity(copy);  // Fix: call _scan_entity instead of scan_entity

  free(copy);
  return 0;
}
```

The fix is to change `scan_entity` to `_scan_entity` in the call to the function. This is because the function is declared with a leading underscore in the `scanentities.h` header file, which indicates that it is a private function.

The full explanation of the fix is as follows:

* The original code calls the `scan_entity` function, but this function is not declared in any of the included header files.
* The `scanentities.h` header file includes the declaration of the `_scan_entity` function, which is the private version of the `scan_entity` function.
* To call the `_scan_entity` function from C++, it is necessary to use the `extern "C"` block to wrap the `#include` directive for the `scanentities.h` header file. This tells the C++ compiler to look for the `_scan_entity` function in the C standard library.
* The `_scan_entity` function is declared with a leading underscore in the `scanentities.h` header file, which indicates that it is a private function. This means that it is not intended to be called from outside of the `scanentities.h` module. However, it is still possible to call the function from C++ by using the `extern "C"` block.

By making the above changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.
