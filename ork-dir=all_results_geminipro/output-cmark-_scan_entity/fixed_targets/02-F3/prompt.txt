Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "htmlparser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "scanentities.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *copy = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(copy, data, size);
  copy[size] = '\0';

  _scan_entity(copy);

  free(copy);
  return 0;
}
```

The `scanentities.h` header file should include the definition of the `_scan_entity` function.

The `extern "C" {}` block is used to wrap the `#include` directive for the `scanentities.h` header file. This is necessary because the `_scan_entity` function is declared in a C header file, and the C++ compiler needs to be told to look for it in the C standard library.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
