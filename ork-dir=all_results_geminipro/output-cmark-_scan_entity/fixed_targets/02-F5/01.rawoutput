```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "htmlparser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "scanentities.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *copy = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  memcpy(copy, data, size);
  copy[size] = '\0';

  _scan_entity(copy);  // Fix: call _scan_entity instead of scan_entity

  free(copy);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that it was calling the `scan_entity` function without the leading underscore, which is required for C++ functions that are defined in C header files. The fix was to change the function call to `_scan_entity`, which is the correct way to call a C function from C++.
