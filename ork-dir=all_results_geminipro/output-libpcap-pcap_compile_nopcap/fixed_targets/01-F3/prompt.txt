Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <pcap/pcap.h>

FILE *
pcap_compile_nopcap(int snaplen_arg, int linktype_arg, struct bpf_program * program, char * buf, int optimize, int mask) {
  return NULL;
}

extern "C" {
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  pcap_compile_nopcap(0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to `pcap_compile_nopcap'
```

This error is caused by the fact that the function `pcap_compile_nopcap` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `pcap/pcap.h`.

To fix the code, we need to add the following line to the top of the file:
```
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
```

This will include the header file that defines the `pcap_compile_nopcap` function, and the code will compile successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
