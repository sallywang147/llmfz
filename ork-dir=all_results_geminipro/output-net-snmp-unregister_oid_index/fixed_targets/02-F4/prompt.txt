Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t value_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  size_t* name = new size_t[name_len];
  size_t* value = new size_t[value_len];
  stream.ConsumeData(name, name_len * sizeof(size_t));
  stream.ConsumeData(value, value_len * sizeof(size_t));

  // Fix: Declare the function `unregister_oid_index`
  void unregister_oid_index(size_t*, size_t, size_t*, size_t);

  // Fix: Call the function `unregister_oid_index`
  unregister_oid_index(name, name_len, value, value_len);

  delete[] name;
  delete[] value;
  return 0;
}

// Fix: Define the function `unregister_oid_index`
void unregister_oid_index(size_t* name, size_t name_len, size_t* value, size_t value_len) {
  // Implementation of the function
}
```
The original code had the following issues:

1. The function `unregister_oid_index` was not declared before it was called.
2. The function `unregister_oid_index` was not defined.

The fixed code declares the function `unregister_oid_index` before it is called and defines the function.

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'unregister_oid_index'
```

This error message means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `unregister_oid_index`. The linker looks for the definition of a function in the object files that are linked together to create the executable. In this case, the linker could not find the definition of the function `unregister_oid_index` in any of the object files.

The solution is to declare the function `unregister_oid_index` before it is called and to define the function. The declaration of the function tells the linker that the function exists, and the definition of the function provides the implementation of the function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
