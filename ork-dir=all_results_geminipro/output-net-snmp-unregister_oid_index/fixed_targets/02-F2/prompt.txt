Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t value_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  size_t* name = new size_t[name_len];
  size_t* value = new size_t[value_len];
  stream.ConsumeData(name, name_len * sizeof(size_t));
  stream.ConsumeData(value, value_len * sizeof(size_t));

  // Fix: Declare the function `unregister_oid_index`
  void unregister_oid_index(size_t*, size_t, size_t*, size_t);

  unregister_oid_index(name, name_len, value, value_len);

  delete[] name;
  delete[] value;
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, the `unregister_oid_index` function is declared before it is called, which resolves the issue of an undefined reference to the function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
