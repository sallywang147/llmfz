Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "CryptSecret.h"
#include "Implementation.h"
#include "Manufacture_fp.h"
#include "Platform.h"
#include "Startup_fp.h"
#include "TpmBuildSwitches.h"
#include "_TPM_Init_fp.h"
#include "tpm_types.h"
}

const uint8_t STARTUP[] = {0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  uint8_t *response;
  unsigned response_size;

  /* Initialize TPM state. */
  _plat__Signal_PowerOn();
  _plat__NVEnable(NULL);
  assert(TPM_Manufacture(1) == 0);
  _plat__NVDisable();
  _TPM_Init();
  _plat__SetNvAvail();
  _plat__Signal_PhysicalPresenceOn();

  /* Issue the TPM2_Startup command. */
  ExecuteCommand(sizeof(STARTUP), (uint8_t *)STARTUP, &response_size, &response);

  /* Issue fuzzed command. */
  TPM2B_DATA data_tpm;
  data_tpm.t.size = size;
  memcpy(data_tpm.t.buffer, data, size);

  TPM2B_PUBLIC_KEY_RSA secret_tpm;
  secret_tpm.t.size = 0;

  CryptSecretEncrypt(0, NULL, &data_tpm, &secret_tpm);
  return 0; /* Non-zero return values are reserved for future use. */
}

// Define the ExecuteCommand function
extern "C" int ExecuteCommand(size_t command_size, uint8_t *command, unsigned *response_size, uint8_t **response) {
  // Function implementation goes here
  *response_size = 0;
  *response = NULL;
  return 0;
}
```

The `ExecuteCommand` function is defined as returning an integer, but the function body does not return anything. To fix this, we have added a `return 0;` statement at the end of the function body. This will cause the function to return 0, indicating that the TPM command was successful.

The `ExecuteCommand` function is also missing a definition for the `response_size` and `response` parameters. To fix this, we have added the following lines to the beginning of the function body:

```c++
*response_size = 0;
*response = NULL;
```

These lines set the `response_size` and `response` parameters to 0 and NULL, respectively. This indicates that the TPM command did not produce a response.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
