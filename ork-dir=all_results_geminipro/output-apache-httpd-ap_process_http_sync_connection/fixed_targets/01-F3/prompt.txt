Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code has the following build issues:

* The `sockaddr_in` type is not defined.

To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that defines this type. In this case, we need to include the `<netinet/in.h>` header file.

* The `ap_process_http_sync_connection` function is not declared.

To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that declares this function. In this case, we need to include the `<httpd.h>` header file.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <netinet/in.h> // Include the necessary header file
#include "httpd.h" // Include the necessary header file

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Allocate a new connection record.
  conn_rec* c = static_cast<conn_rec*>(calloc(1, sizeof(conn_rec)));
  if (c == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Initialize the connection record.
  c->client_socket = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  c->local_addr = stream.ConsumeBytes<sockaddr_in>(sizeof(sockaddr_in));
  c->remote_addr = stream.ConsumeBytes<sockaddr_in>(sizeof(sockaddr_in));
  c->notes = stream.ConsumeBytes<void>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1000));
  c->notes_length = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  int result = ap_process_http_sync_connection(c);

  // Free the connection record.
  free(c->notes);
  free(c);

  return result;
}
```

With this change, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
