    resize.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));

```

The issue in the original code was that the `Parser::Resize` object was created without passing the `Terminal::Emulator` object as an argument to its constructor. This resulted in the `act_on_terminal` method not being able to access the emulator object, leading to the build error.

To fix this, the `Parser::Resize` object is created with the `Terminal::Emulator` object as an argument, allowing the `act_on_terminal` method to access the emulator object and perform the intended operations.
