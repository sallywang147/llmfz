Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include <png.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Generate a random string of up to 1024 characters.
  const size_t max_string_length = 1024;
  char* argument = new char[max_string_length + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(argument, max_string_length);
  argument[max_string_length] = '\0';

  // Call the function under test.
  int result = png_image_read_colormapped(argument);

  // Clean up.
  delete[] argument;

  return result;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that it was missing the `#include <png.h>` directive. This directive is necessary to include the header file for the libpng library, which contains the declaration for the `png_image_read_colormapped` function.

The fixed code includes the necessary header file and should now compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
