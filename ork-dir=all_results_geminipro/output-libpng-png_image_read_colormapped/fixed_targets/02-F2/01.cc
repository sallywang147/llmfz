extern "C" {

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  int ret = png_image_read_colormapped(const_cast<char*>(file_name.c_str()));
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `png_image_read_colormapped` function is declared with a `const` pointer to a `char` array, but the `file_name` variable is a `std::string` object. This will cause a compiler error.
2. The `png_image_read_colormapped` function is declared in the `png.h` header file, which is not included in the code. This will cause a linker error.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Change the declaration of the `png_image_read_colormapped` function to take a non-`const` pointer to a `char` array.
2. Include the `png.h` header file in the code.

The corrected code is shown above.
