Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "SQLParser.h"

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  SQLParserResult res;
  SQLParser::parseSQLString(input, &res);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build error because the `SQLParser.h` header file is not included with the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is necessary because the header file contains C++ code, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is declared as a C function.

To fix the error, the `#include "SQLParser.h"` line should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This will tell the compiler to treat the header file as a C header file, even though it contains C++ code.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <string>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "SQLParser.h"

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  SQLParserResult res;
  SQLParser::parseSQLString(input, &res);
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should build successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
