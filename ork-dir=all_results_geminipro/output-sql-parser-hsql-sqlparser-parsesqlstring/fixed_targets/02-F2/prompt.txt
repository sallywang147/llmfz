Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "SQLParser.h"
#include <string>

using namespace hsql;

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutate.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  SQLParserResult res;
  SQLParser::parseSQLString(input, &res);
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'
```
This means that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `llvm/FuzzMutate.h`. We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is properly linked.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
