Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

struct EncoderCore {
  template <typename T, bool D>
  bool Run(EncoderCore* core, char*, size_t, bool) {
    return true;
  }
};

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  EncoderCore core;
  const size_t input_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, size);
  const char* input_buffer = reinterpret_cast<const char*>(stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(input_size).data());
  core.Run<short, true>(&core, const_cast<char*>(input_buffer), input_size, false);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `Run` function is declared as a template function, but it's not defined.
2. The `input_buffer` is declared as a `const char*`, but it's passed to the `Run` function as a `char*`. This is a type mismatch.
3. The `input_buffer` is declared as a `const char*`, but it's modified by the `ConsumeBytes` function. This is a violation of the const-correctness rule.

The fixed code addresses these issues:

1. The `Run` function is defined as a non-template function.
2. The `input_buffer` is declared as a `char*` to match the type of the `Run` function's parameter.
3. The `input_buffer` is modified by the `ConsumeBytes` function, but it's passed to the `Run` function as a `const char*`. This is a violation of the const-correctness rule. To fix this, the `input_buffer` is cast to a `char*` before it's passed to the `Run` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
