Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "private_settings.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  struct private_settings_t *this_ = new private_settings_t;
  size_t settings_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *settings = new char[settings_size + 1];
  provider.ConsumeBytes(settings, settings_size);
  settings[settings_size] = '\0';
  bool merge = provider.ConsumeBool();
  bool ret = load_string(this_, settings, merge);
  delete[] settings;
  delete this_;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has an issue with the `load_string` function. The declaration of `load_string` is missing. To fix this, one needs to include the necessary header file that contains the declaration of `load_string`.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file `private_settings.h`, which is assumed to contain the declaration of `load_string`.

The corrected code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
