Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libcue.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libcue.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int key_count = cdtext_get_key_count();
  for (int i = 0; i < key_count; i++) {
    char *key = cdtext_get_key(i, 0);
    // Do something with the key.
    free(key);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
In this case, the error message indicates that the function `cdtext_get_key_count` and `cdtext_get_key` are not defined. To fix this, we need to include the header file `libcue.h` and wrap it with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the header file is written in C, and we need to use the C linkage specification to ensure that the function names are not mangled by the C++ compiler.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
