Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The build error is likely due to the missing declaration of the `cdtext_get_key` function. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that declares this function.

The corrected code with the necessary header file included is given below:

```c++
#include "libcue.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "cdtext.h" // Include the necessary header file

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  uint32_t key = *(uint32_t *)data;
  cdtext_get_key(key, 0); // Call the cdtext_get_key function
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should build successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
