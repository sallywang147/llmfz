Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "mutate.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct param p;
  const int seed = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  mutate(&p, seed, flags);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing header `mutate.h`, which contains the declaration of the `mutate` function. To fix this error, we need to include the `mutate.h` header in the code.

We also need to wrap the `#include "mutate.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the `mutate` function is declared in a C header file. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler generates the correct linkage for the function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
