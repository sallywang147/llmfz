The build error is caused by the missing header `mutate.h`, which contains the declaration of the `mutate` function. To fix this error, we need to include the `mutate.h` header in the code.

We also need to wrap the `#include "mutate.h"` directive with `extern "C" {}` because the `mutate` function is declared in a C header file. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler generates the correct linkage for the function.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
