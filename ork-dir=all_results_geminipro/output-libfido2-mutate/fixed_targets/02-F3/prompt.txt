Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_mutator.h>
}

struct param {
  int a;
  int b;
  int c;
};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct param p;
  p.a = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  p.b = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  p.c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int seed = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int flags = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  mutate(&p, seed, flags);
  return 0;
}

extern "C" int mutate(param* p, int seed, int flags) {
  // Mutate the struct here.
  return 0;
}
```
The original code was missing the definition of the `mutate` function, which is called from `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.

The fixed code includes the definition of the `mutate` function, which takes a pointer to a `param` struct, a seed, and some flags as arguments.

The `mutate` function can then be used to mutate the `param` struct in some way.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
