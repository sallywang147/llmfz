Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "resip/resip.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  resip::Transport* transport = new resip::Transport();
  resip::SipMessage* sip_message = new resip::SipMessage();
  const int status_code = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string reason_phrase = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char* reason_phrase_cstr = new char[reason_phrase.size() + 1];
  std::strcpy(reason_phrase_cstr, reason_phrase.c_str());

  transport->makeFailedResponse(transport, sip_message, status_code,
                                reason_phrase_cstr);
  delete[] reason_phrase_cstr;
  delete sip_message;
  delete transport;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `resip` library is not included. To fix this, we need to add the following line at the beginning of the code:
```c++
#include "resip/resip.h"
```
2. The `makeFailedResponse` function is not defined. To fix this, we need to add the following line at the beginning of the code:
```c++
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size);
```

After applying these fixes, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
