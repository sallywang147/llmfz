Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "mpeg2d_fast_dec_vld.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct _stream_t ps_stream;
  ps_stream.p_buffer = const_cast<uint8_t*>(data);
  ps_stream.size_buffer = size;
  ps_stream.byte_ptr = 0;
  ps_stream.bit_ptr = 0;

  const bool ai2_code_table = stream.ConsumeBool();
  const bool au2_indexTable = stream.ConsumeBool();
  const short u2_max_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<short>();

  short res = impeg2d_fast_dec_vld_symbol(&ps_stream, ai2_code_table, au2_indexTable, u2_max_len);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
