Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "mpeg2d_fast_dec.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mpeg2d_fast_dec_vlc.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      1, std::min(size, static_cast<size_t>(1 << 16)));
  uint8_t* buffer = new uint8_t[buffer_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(buffer, buffer_size);

  struct _stream_t stream_struct = {
      .p_buffer = buffer,
      .buffer_size = buffer_size,
      .buffer_index = 0,
      .p_bit_buffer = nullptr,
      .bit_buffer_size = 0,
      .bit_buffer_index = 0,
      .error_code = 0,
      .p_error_message = nullptr,
      .p_user_data = nullptr,
  };

  const bool ai2_code_table = stream.ConsumeBool();
  const bool au2_index_table = stream.ConsumeBool();
  const int u2_max_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const short result = impeg2d_fast_dec_vld_symbol(
      &stream_struct, ai2_code_table, au2_index_table, u2_max_len);

  delete[] buffer;
  return result;
}
```

The original code had no errors. The build issues were caused by the missing `extern "C" {}` around the `#include` directive for `mpeg2d_fast_dec_vlc.h`. This directive is necessary when including C headers in C++ code to ensure that the C compiler uses the correct calling convention.

The corrected code includes the `extern "C" {}` directive around the `#include` directive for `mpeg2d_fast_dec_vlc.h`, which should resolve the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
