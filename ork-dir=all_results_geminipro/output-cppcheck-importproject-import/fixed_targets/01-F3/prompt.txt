Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "settings.h"

extern "C" {
#include "importproject.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::string project_path = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  ImportProject import_project;
  Settings settings;
  import_project.import(nullptr, &project_path, &settings);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* The `importproject.h` header file was not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `importproject.h` header file contains C++ code, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is a C function.
* The `settings.h` header file was not included.

The corrected code fixes these issues by wrapping the `importproject.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and including the `settings.h` header file.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
