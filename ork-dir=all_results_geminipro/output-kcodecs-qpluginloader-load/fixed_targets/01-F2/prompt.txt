Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <QPluginLoader>
#include <QLibrary>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  void *data_ptr = bytes.data();

  QLibrary lib(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data_ptr));
  QPluginLoader loader(&lib);
  loader.load();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `#include <QPluginLoader>` and `#include <QLibrary>` directives are missing `extern "C" {}` wrappers. This causes the linker to fail to find the definitions of the `QPluginLoader` and `QLibrary` classes.

To fix the issue, wrap the `#include` directives with `extern "C" {}` as follows:

```cpp
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <QPluginLoader>
#include <QLibrary>
}
```

2. The `QLibrary` constructor is called with a `const char *` argument, but the `data_ptr` variable is of type `void *`. This causes a compiler error.

To fix the issue, cast `data_ptr` to `const char *` as follows:

```cpp
QLibrary lib(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data_ptr));
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
