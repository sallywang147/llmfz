Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <jsoncons.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  jsoncons::json_decoder<jsoncons::basic_json<char, jsoncons::order_preserving_policy, std::__1::allocator<char> >, std::__1::allocator<char> > decoder;
  std::exception* exception = nullptr;
  std::error_code* error_code = nullptr;
  const std::string json_string = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  decoder.parse_string(json_string, exception, error_code);
  decoder.visit_end_object(nullptr, exception, error_code);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code calls the `visit_end_object` method of the `jsoncons::json_decoder` object after parsing the JSON string. This is necessary to ensure that the decoder's internal state is properly cleaned up.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
