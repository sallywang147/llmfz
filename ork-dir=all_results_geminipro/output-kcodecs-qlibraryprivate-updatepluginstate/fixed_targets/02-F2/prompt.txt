Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QPluginLoader>
#include <QDir>
#include <QFile>
#include <QFileInfo>
#include <QTextStream>
#include <QDebug>

#include <cstdio>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  QCoreApplication app(0, nullptr);
  QDir dir(QDir::tempPath());
  QString temp_plugin_path = dir.absolutePath() + "/libpluginXXXXXX.so";
  QFile file(temp_plugin_path);
  file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
  file.write((const char *)data, size);
  file.close();

  QPluginLoader loader(temp_plugin_path);
  QObject *plugin = loader.instance();
  if (plugin) {
    QLibraryPrivate *d = reinterpret_cast<QLibraryPrivate *>(loader.d_func());
    d->updatePluginState(d);
  }

  file.remove();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

1. `cstdio` was not included, which is needed for `remove`.
2. `QFile::remove()` was missing a semicolon at the end of the line.

The fixed code includes `cstdio` and adds the missing semicolon to `QFile::remove()`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
