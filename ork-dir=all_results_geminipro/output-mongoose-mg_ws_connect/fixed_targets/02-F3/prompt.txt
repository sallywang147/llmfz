Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct mg_mgr mgr;
  mg_mgr_init(&mgr);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_ws_connect(&mgr, url.c_str(), nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  mg_mgr_free(&mgr);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a typo in the `mg_ws_connect` function call. The `url` variable was passed as a `const char*` instead of a `char*`. This caused a compiler error because `mg_ws_connect` expects a `char*` as its second argument.

The corrected code fixes this typo by passing `url.c_str()` as the second argument to `mg_ws_connect`. This ensures that the function is called correctly and the program compiles without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
