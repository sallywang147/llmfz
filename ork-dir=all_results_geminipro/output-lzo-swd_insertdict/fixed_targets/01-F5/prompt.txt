Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "lzo2a_999.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct lzo2a_999_swd_t s;
  const size_t node = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  swd_init(&s); // Initialize the sliding window data structure
  swd_insertdict(&s, node, len);
  swd_free(&s); // Free the sliding window data structure
  return 0;
}
```

The missing function `swd_free` has been added to the code. This function is responsible for freeing the allocated memory for the sliding window data structure. Without this function call, the memory would not be properly released after use, leading to memory leaks.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
