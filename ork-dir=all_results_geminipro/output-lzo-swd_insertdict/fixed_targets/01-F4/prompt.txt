Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "lzo2a_999.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct lzo2a_999_swd_t s;
  const size_t node = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  swd_init(&s); // Initialize the sliding window data structure
  swd_insertdict(&s, node, len);
  swd_free(&s); // Free the sliding window data structure
  return 0;
}
```

In the original code, the `swd_free` function was missing, which is necessary to free the allocated memory for the sliding window data structure. Adding this function call ensures that the memory is properly released after use.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
