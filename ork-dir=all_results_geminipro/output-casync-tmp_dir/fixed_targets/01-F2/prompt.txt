Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <tmp_dir.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t max_length = 1024;
  std::vector<uint8_t> input_buffer =
      provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, max_length));
  char* input_string = reinterpret_cast<char*>(input_buffer.data());
  char* output_string;
  int ret = tmp_dir(&output_string);
  free(output_string);
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the issue is that the function `tmp_dir` is declared in a C header file, but the code is compiled as C++. To fix this, the header file needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to indicate that the function is written in C.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
