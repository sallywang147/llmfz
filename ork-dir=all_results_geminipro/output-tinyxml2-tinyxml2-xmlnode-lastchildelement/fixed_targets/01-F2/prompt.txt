Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
#if !defined(_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS)
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#endif
#endif
#include "tinyxml2/tinyxml2.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string>

#if defined(_MSC_VER) || defined(WIN32)
#include <crtdbg.h>
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#include <windows.h>
_CrtMemState startMemState;
_CrtMemState endMemState;
#else
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#endif

using namespace tinyxml2;
using namespace std;

// Entry point for LibFuzzer.
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string data_string(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  XMLDocument doc;
  doc.Parse(data_string.c_str());
  const tinyxml2::XMLElement* element = doc.FirstChildElement();
  if (element != nullptr) {
    element->LastChildElement("name");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
The issue is that the `LastChildElement` function is not declared in the `tinyxml2` library. To fix this, the following line needs to be added to the top of the file:

```c++
extern "C" const tinyxml2::XMLElement* LastChildElement(const tinyxml2::XMLElement* element, const char* name);
```

This line declares the `LastChildElement` function as an external function, which means that it is defined in another library. The `extern "C"` keyword is used to tell the compiler that the function is written in C, rather than C++. This is necessary because the `tinyxml2` library is written in C++.

Once this line is added, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
