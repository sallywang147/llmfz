Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "siphash.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"
#include "llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size == 0)
    return 0;

  // Set the hash salt using siphash to generate a deterministic hash.
  struct sipkey key = sip_keyof(data);
  sip24_valid(&key);

  // Print the hash value.
  llvm::outs() << sip24(&key, data, size) << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had the following issues:

* It was missing the `llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h` header, which is needed for printing the hash value.
* It was not printing the hash value.

The fixed code includes the missing header and prints the hash value using `llvm::outs()`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
