```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "siphash.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  siphash24(data, size, sip_keyof("FUZZING IS FUN!"));
  sip24_valid();
  return 0;
}
```

The original code is missing the necessary headers to build a fuzzer. To fix the issue, the following headers are included:

* `<stdint.h>`: Provides standard integer types.
* `<stdlib.h>`: Provides general purpose functions.
* `"siphash.h"`: Provides the SipHash-2-4 function.
* `"llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"`: Provides the LLVM command-line parsing functionality.

Additionally, the `extern "C"` block is added to wrap the `#include` directive for `"llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"`. This is necessary to ensure that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is exported with C linkage, which is required by the fuzzer driver.
