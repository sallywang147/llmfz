Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.init_diff(nullptr, &complete);

  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the error is caused by the missing `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include "src/terminal/parser.h"` directive. This is necessary because the `Terminal::Complete` and `Parser::UserByte` functions are defined in a C++ header file, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is defined in a C file. The `extern "C"` wrapper tells the compiler that the functions in the header file are written in C, not C++.

The fixed code includes the `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include "src/terminal/parser.h"` directive, and it compiles and runs successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
