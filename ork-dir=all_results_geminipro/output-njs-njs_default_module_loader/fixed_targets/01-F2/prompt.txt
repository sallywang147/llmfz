Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "njs.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string external = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct njs_str_t name;
  name.length = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  name.ptr = const_cast<char*>(external.c_str());
  struct njs_vm_s vm;
  njs_init(&vm, 0);
  struct njs_mod_s* mod = njs_default_module_loader(&vm, const_cast<char*>(external.c_str()), &name);
  njs_free_module(&vm, mod);
  njs_free_vm(&vm);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `njs.h` header include. This is necessary because the `njs.h` header contains C functions and data structures, which need to be declared with the `extern "C"` linkage specification in order to be visible to the C++ compiler.
2. Changed the `njs_init()` function call to pass in a `0` as the second argument. This is necessary because the `njs_init()` function expects a pointer to a `njs_config_t` struct as its second argument, but the code was not passing in any value for this argument.
3. Changed the `njs_default_module_loader()` function call to pass in a `const_cast<char*>(external.c_str())` as the second argument. This is necessary because the `njs_default_module_loader()` function expects a `char*` as its second argument, but the code was passing in a `std::string` object. The `const_cast<char*>(external.c_str())` expression casts the `std::string` object to a `char*` pointer.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
