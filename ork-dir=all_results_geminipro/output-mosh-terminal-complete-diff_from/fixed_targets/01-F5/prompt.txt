Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
#include "src/terminal/terminal.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete existing(80, 24);
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.diff_from(&existing, &complete);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `src/terminal/parser.h` is not included. This header file defines the `Parser::UserByte` function.
2. The function `Parser::UserByte` is not defined in the code.

To fix these issues, we have made the following changes:

1. We have added the following line to the top of the file:

```
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
```

This line includes the header file that defines the `Parser::UserByte` function.

2. We have added the following line to the bottom of the file:

```
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete existing(80, 24);
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.diff_from(&existing, &complete);

  return 0;
}
```

This line defines the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is the entry point for the fuzzer.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
