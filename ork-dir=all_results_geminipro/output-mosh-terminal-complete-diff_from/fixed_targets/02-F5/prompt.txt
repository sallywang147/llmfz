Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <terminal/completeterminal.h>
#include <terminal/parser.h>

extern "C" {
#include "src/statesync/completeterminal.h"
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  Terminal::Complete existing(80, 24);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }

  // Define a simple callback function for diff_from
  void DiffCallback(Terminal::Complete::DiffType type, int x, int y, int w, int h) {
    // Do something with the difference information
  }

  // Call diff_from with the callback function
  complete.diff_from(existing, DiffCallback);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `Terminal` and `Parser` namespaces were not defined in the global scope, which caused the compiler to generate undefined reference errors. To fix this, the `Terminal` and `Parser` namespaces were added to the global scope using the `extern "C"` directive. This directive tells the compiler to treat the included headers as C headers, which allows the compiler to find the definitions of the `Terminal` and `Parser` namespaces.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
