Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "src/statesync/completeterminal.h"
#include "src/terminal/parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  Terminal::Complete complete(80, 24);
  Terminal::Complete existing(80, 24);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    complete.act(Parser::UserByte(data[i]));
  }
  complete.diff_from(existing, nullptr);

  return 0;
}
```

The code is missing the `#include` directives for the `Terminal` and `Parser` namespaces. To fix this, add the following lines to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <terminal/completeterminal.h>
#include <terminal/parser.h>
```

Additionally, the `diff_from` method of the `Terminal::Complete` class takes a third argument of type `Terminal::Complete::DiffCallback`. This callback is used to report the differences between the two terminals. In the provided code, this argument is set to `nullptr`, which is not a valid callback. To fix this, you can define a simple callback function and pass it as the third argument to `diff_from`. For example:

```c++
void DiffCallback(Terminal::Complete::DiffType type, int x, int y, int w, int h) {
  // Do something with the difference information
}
```

Then, in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, you can call `diff_from` like this:

```c++
complete.diff_from(existing, DiffCallback);
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
