Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hdf5.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  hid_t fuzz_h5_id = H5Fopen(filename, H5F_ACC_RDWR, H5P_DEFAULT);
  if (fuzz_h5_id != H5I_INVALID_HID) {
    hid_t dataset_id = H5Dopen2(fuzz_h5_id, "dsetname", H5P_DEFAULT);
    if (dataset_id != H5I_INVALID_HID) {
      hid_t filespace = H5Dget_space(dataset_id);
      hid_t memspace = H5Screate_simple(1, &size, NULL);
      size_t num_elements;
      int ret = H5D__virtual_pre_io(
          reinterpret_cast<H5D_t *>(dataset_id), NULL, filespace, memspace,
          &num_elements);
      if (ret != 0) {
        // Handle error
      }
      H5Sclose(filespace);
      H5Sclose(memspace);
      H5Dclose(dataset_id);
    }
    H5Fclose(fuzz_h5_id);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the C standard library functions `sprintf`, `fopen`, `fwrite`, `fclose` were not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This caused a linker error because the C++ compiler was trying to mangle the names of these functions, which is not compatible with the C linkage used by the HDF5 library.

To fix the issue, the `#include` directives for the C standard library headers `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>` were wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to use the C linkage for these functions, which prevents the name mangling and allows the linker to find the correct implementations of the functions.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
