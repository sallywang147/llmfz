The issue was that the file created by `fopen` was not being deleted after use. This caused the file to remain open, which prevented the HDF5 library from closing the file and releasing its resources.

To fix the issue, the `remove` function was added to delete the file after it was no longer needed. This ensures that the file is closed and the HDF5 library can release its resources.
