Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define TINYOBJLOADER_IMPLEMENTATION // define this in only *one* .cc
#include "tiny_obj_loader.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  tinyobj::material_t material;
  tinyobj::material_t material_copy;
  material.material_t(&material_copy);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'llvm::cl::opt<std::string>'
```

This error is caused by the use of the LLVM command line library without properly including the necessary headers. To fix this, we need to include the LLVM command line headers and wrap the inclusion with `extern "C" {}`.

The corrected code includes the necessary LLVM headers and wraps the inclusion with `extern "C" {}`. This allows the linker to find the definition of `llvm::cl::opt<std::string>`.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
