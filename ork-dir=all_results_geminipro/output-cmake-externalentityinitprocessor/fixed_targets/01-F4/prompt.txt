Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "expat.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<uint8_t> context_bytes = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(
      stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 100));
  XML_Parser parser = XML_ParserCreate(nullptr);
  XML_SetUserData(parser, context_bytes.data());

  const std::string open_entity_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = XML_ExternalEntityInitProcessor(parser,
                                          const_cast<char*>(open_entity_name.c_str()),
                                          nullptr, nullptr);
  XML_ParserFree(parser);

  return result;
}
```

The following changes were made to the original code:

1. `externalEntityInitProcessor` was changed to `XML_ExternalEntityInitProcessor`.
2. `expat.h` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`.

These changes resolve the build errors and allow the code to compile and run as intended.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
