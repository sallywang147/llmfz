Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "mail_params.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mail_params.c"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    mail_params_init();
    initialized = true;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // mail_params_init() only takes a single argument, so we'll just
  // provide it with a random integer.
  int arg = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 100);

  mail_params_init(arg);

  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the issue is that `mail_params_init()` takes a single argument, but the code was providing it with a random integer. To fix this, the code was updated to use `ConsumeIntegralInRange()` to generate a random integer within a specified range. The range was set to 0-100 to ensure that the argument is valid.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
