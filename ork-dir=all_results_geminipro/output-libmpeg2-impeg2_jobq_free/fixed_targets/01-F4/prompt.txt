Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The fixed code:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "mpeg2_jobq.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libavutil/avutil.h>
}

extern "C" void impeg2_jobq_free(struct jobq_t* jobq);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct jobq_t* jobq = new struct jobq_t;
  jobq->ps_job = new struct job_t;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_next = nullptr;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_prev = nullptr;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data = new struct job_data_t;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->ps_buffer = new uint8_t[128];
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->i_buffer = 128;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->i_offset = 0;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->i_size = 0;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->i_frame = 0;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->i_flags = 0;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->ps_user_data = nullptr;
  jobq->ps_job->ps_data->ps_user_data2 = nullptr;
  jobq->i_job_count = 1;
  jobq->ps_tail = jobq->ps_job;
  jobq->ps_head = jobq->ps_job;
  jobq->i_max_jobs = 1;

  impeg2_jobq_free(jobq);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing declaration of the function `impeg2_jobq_free`. To fix this, the declaration of the function is added to the code.

The fixed code compiles and runs successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
