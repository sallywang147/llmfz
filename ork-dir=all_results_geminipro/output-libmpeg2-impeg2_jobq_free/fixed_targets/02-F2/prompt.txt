Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "impeg2_jobq.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct jobq_t* ps_jobq = reinterpret_cast<struct jobq_t*>(
      stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>()));
  impeg2_jobq_free(ps_jobq);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing header file `impeg2_jobq.h`. To fix it, we need to include this header file with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function `impeg2_jobq_free` is exported with C linkage.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
