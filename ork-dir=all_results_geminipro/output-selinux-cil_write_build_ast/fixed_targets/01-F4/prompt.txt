Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'cil_db_init'
error: undefined reference to 'cil_db_load_module'
error: undefined reference to 'cil_write_build_ast'
error: undefined reference to 'cil_db_destroy'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of the functions `cil_db_init`, `cil_db_load_module`, `cil_write_build_ast`, and `cil_db_destroy`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares these functions is included in the compilation.

The header file that declares these functions is `cil_internal.h`. We need to include this header file in the compilation by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```
#include "cil_internal.h"
```

Once we have included the header file, the linker will be able to find the definitions of the functions and the build error will be fixed.

The corrected code:
```
#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cil.h"

#include "cil_internal.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  struct cil_db db;
  cil_db_init(&db);

  // Initialize the database.
  int ret = cil_db_load_module(&db, provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str());
  if (ret != 0) {
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Create a temporary file.
  FILE* tmpfile = tmpfile();
  if (tmpfile == nullptr) {
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Write the AST to the temporary file.
  ret = cil_write_build_ast(tmpfile, &db);
  if (ret != 0) {
    fclose(tmpfile);
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Close the temporary file.
  fclose(tmpfile);

  // Destroy the database.
  cil_db_destroy(&db);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
