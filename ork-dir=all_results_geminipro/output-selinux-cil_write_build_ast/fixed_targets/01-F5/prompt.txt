Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cil.h"

#include "cil_internal.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  struct cil_db db;
  cil_db_init(&db);

  // Initialize the database.
  int ret = cil_db_load_module(&db, provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str());
  if (ret != 0) {
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Create a temporary file.
  FILE* tmpfile = tmpfile();
  if (tmpfile == nullptr) {
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Write the AST to the temporary file.
  ret = cil_write_build_ast(tmpfile, &db);
  if (ret != 0) {
    fclose(tmpfile);
    cil_db_destroy(&db);
    return 0;
  }

  // Close the temporary file.
  fclose(tmpfile);

  // Destroy the database.
  cil_db_destroy(&db);

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code:
1. Included the header file `cil_internal.h` which declares the functions `cil_db_init`, `cil_db_load_module`, `cil_write_build_ast`, and `cil_db_destroy`.
2. Wrapped the `#include` directive for `cil_internal.h` with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the linker can find the definitions of the functions.

With these changes, the build error should be fixed and the code should compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
