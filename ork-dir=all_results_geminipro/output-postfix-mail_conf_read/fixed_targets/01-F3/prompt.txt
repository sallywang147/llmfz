Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "mail_conf.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mail_conf.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  // Initialize the fuzzer.
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  // Read the configuration file.
  char* config_file = provider.ConsumeRandomLengthString().c_str();
  mail_conf_read(config_file);

  // Free the configuration file.
  free(config_file);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mail_conf.h` header is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This can cause linker errors.
2. The `mail_conf_read()` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but its definition is not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This can also cause linker errors.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The `mail_conf.h` header is included only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper.
2. The `mail_conf_read()` function is defined inside the `extern "C" {}` block.

These changes should fix the linker errors and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
