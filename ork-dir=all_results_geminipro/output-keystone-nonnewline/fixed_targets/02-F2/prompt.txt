Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "parser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "parser.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  struct parse* p = parse_new();
  if (p == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  std::vector<uint8_t> input(data, data + size);
  input.push_back('\n');
  parse_buffer(p, input.data(), input.size());
  nonnewline(p);
  parse_free(p);

  return 0;
}
```

The issue was that the `parser.h` header was included twice: once with the `#include "parser.h"` directive and once with the `extern "C" {` directive. This caused a duplicate definition of the `parse_new`, `parse_buffer`, `nonnewline`, and `parse_free` functions. To fix the issue, the `#include "parser.h"` directive was removed and the `parser.h` header was instead included with the `extern "C" {` directive. This ensured that the functions were defined only once.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
