Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h>
}

struct parse {
  std::string str;
};

extern "C" void LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  parse p;
  p.str = provider.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  nonnewline(&p);
}
```

The build issue is caused by missing the necessary header file `libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h` for the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function. To fix it, we need to include this header file within the `extern "C" {}` block. This ensures that the function is properly declared and linked during compilation.

The corrected code includes the `libFuzzer/libFuzzer.h` header within the `extern "C" {}` block, allowing the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to be recognized and linked successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
