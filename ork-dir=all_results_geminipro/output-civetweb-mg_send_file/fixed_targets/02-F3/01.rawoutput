```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "mongoose.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t path_length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* path = new char[path_length + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(path, path_length);
  path[path_length] = '\0';

  struct mg_connection conn;
  mg_send_file(&conn, path, path_length, NULL);  // Fix the function call
  delete[] path;
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the code was that the `mg_send_file` function was called incorrectly. It should take four arguments: `&conn`, `path`, `path_length`, and `NULL`. The original code only passed three arguments, which caused the build error.

The corrected code calls `mg_send_file` with the correct number of arguments, and it should now build and run successfully.
