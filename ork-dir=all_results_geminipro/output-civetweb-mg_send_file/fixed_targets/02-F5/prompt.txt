Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "mongoose.h"

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t path_length = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* path = new char[path_length + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(path, path_length);
  path[path_length] = '\0';

  struct mg_connection conn;
  mg_send_file(&conn, path, path_length, NULL);  // Fix the function call
  delete[] path;
  return 0;
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added `NULL` as the fourth argument to `mg_send_file`.

The corrected code calls `mg_send_file` with the correct number of arguments, and it should now build and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
