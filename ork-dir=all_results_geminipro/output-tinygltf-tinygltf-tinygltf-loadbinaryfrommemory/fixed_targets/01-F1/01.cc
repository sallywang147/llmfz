The build error is caused by the missing declaration of the `stb_image.h` and `stb_image_write.h` headers. To fix this, the `extern "C" {}` block is added to wrap the `#include` directives for these headers. This is necessary because these headers are written in C and not C++, and the C++ compiler needs to be explicitly told to use the C calling convention when including them.

The `extern "C" {}` block tells the compiler that the code within it is written in C and should be compiled as such. This allows the compiler to correctly handle the C-style function declarations and data structures in these headers.
