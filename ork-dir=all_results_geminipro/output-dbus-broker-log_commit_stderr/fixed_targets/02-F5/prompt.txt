Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "log.h"

extern "C" {
#include <cstdarg>
#include <cstdint>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  _c_cleanup_(log_freep) struct Log *log = log_new();
  if (log == NULL)
    return 0;

  log->fd = -1;

  char *format = (char *)data;
  if (size < 1)
    return 0;

  size_t fmt_len = 0;
  while (fmt_len < size && format[fmt_len] != '\0')
    fmt_len++;

  if (fmt_len == size)
    return 0;

  va_list args;
  va_start(args, format);

  log_commit_stderr(log, format, args);

  va_end(args);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

1. Added `#include <cstdint>` to include the `uint8_t` type.
2. Changed `#include <cstdarg>` to `extern "C" {#include <cstdarg>}` to ensure that the `va_start` and `va_end` functions are properly linked.
3. Changed `#include <stdarg.h>` to `extern "C" {#include <stdarg.h>}` to ensure that the `va_list` type is properly linked.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
