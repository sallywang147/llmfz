Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

#include "log.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Log log;
  log_init(&log, NULL);
  log_commit_stderr(&log, (char *)data, (struct __va_list_tag *)data);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'log_init'
error: undefined reference to 'log_commit_stderr'
```

This error occurs because the functions `log_init` and `log_commit_stderr` are declared in the header file `log.h`, but they are not defined in the source file. To fix this error, we need to include the definition of these functions in the source file.

We can do this by adding the following line to the top of the source file:

```c++
#include "log.c"
```

This will include the definition of the functions `log_init` and `log_commit_stderr` from the file `log.c`.

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive for the header file `stdio.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is because the header file `stdio.h` is written in C, and the compiler needs to know that the functions declared in this header file are C functions, not C++ functions.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
