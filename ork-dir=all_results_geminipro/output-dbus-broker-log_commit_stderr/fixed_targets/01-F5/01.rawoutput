```c++
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

#include "log.c"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Log log;
  log_init(&log, NULL);
  log_commit_stderr(&log, (char *)data, (struct __va_list_tag *)data);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the following changes:

* The line `#include "log.c"` has been added to the top of the source file. This includes the definition of the functions `log_init` and `log_commit_stderr` from the file `log.c`.
* The `#include` directive for the header file `stdio.h` has been wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the functions declared in this header file are C functions, not C++ functions.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
