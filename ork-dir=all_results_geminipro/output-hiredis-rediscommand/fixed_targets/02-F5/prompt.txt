Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str, *reply;
  redisContext *c;

  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  new_str = malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  c = redisConnect("localhost", 6379);
  if (c == NULL) {
    free(new_str);
    return 0;
  }

  reply = (char *)redisCommand(c, new_str);
  if (reply != NULL) {
    freeReplyObject(reply);
  }

  redisFree(c);
  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `hiredis/hiredis.h` is included twice, once with `#include "hiredis.h"` and once with `#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>`. This can cause compilation errors or undefined references.
2. The function `freeReplyObject` is declared in the header file `hiredis/hiredis.h`, but it is not defined in the code. This can cause a linker error.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The header file `hiredis/hiredis.h` is included only once, with `#include "hiredis.h"`.
2. The function `freeReplyObject` is defined in the code, by including the header file `hiredis/hiredis.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to look for the definition of `freeReplyObject` in the C library, rather than in the C++ standard library.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
