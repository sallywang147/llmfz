The error message indicates that `hi_free` is not defined. This is because `hi_free` is a function from the hiredis library, which is not included in the C++ standard library. To fix this, we need to include the hiredis header file using `extern "C" {}` to tell the compiler that the function is defined in a C library.

In the fixed code, we have wrapped the `#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>` line with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the functions and data types declared in the hiredis header file are defined in a C library, and should be used as such.

We have also changed `hi_free(cmd);` to `free(cmd);` because `hi_free` is not a standard C function, and should not be used in C++.
