Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "hiredis.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
  #include <hiredis/hiredis.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *new_str, *cmd;

  if (size < 3)
    return 0;

  new_str = malloc(size + 1);
  if (new_str == NULL)
    return 0;

  memcpy(new_str, data, size);
  new_str[size] = '\0';

  if (redisCommand(NULL, new_str) != NULL)
    free(cmd); // Fix: Change 'hi_free' to 'free'

  free(new_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message indicates that `hi_free` is not defined. This is because `hi_free` is a function from the hiredis library, which is not included in the C++ standard library. To fix this, we need to include the hiredis header file using `extern "C" {}` to tell the compiler that the function is defined in a C library.

In the fixed code, we have wrapped the `#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>` line with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the functions and data types declared in the hiredis header file are defined in a C library, and should be used as such.

We have also changed `hi_free(cmd);` to `free(cmd);` because `hi_free` is not a standard C function, and should not be used in C++.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
