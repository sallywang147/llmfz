  }

  utf8proc_unicode_version();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `utf8proc.h` is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is not necessary and can lead to linker errors.
2. The function `utf8proc_init()` is declared as `extern "C"`, but the function `utf8proc_unicode_version()` is not. This can also lead to linker errors.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The header file `utf8proc.h` is included only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper.
2. The function `utf8proc_unicode_version()` is declared as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
