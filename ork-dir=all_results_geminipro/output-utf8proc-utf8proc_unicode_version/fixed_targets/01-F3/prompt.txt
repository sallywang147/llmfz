Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "utf8proc.h"

extern "C" {
#include "utf8proc.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    utf8proc_init();
    initialized = true;
  }

  std::vector<uint8_t> input_buffer(data, data + size);
  utf8proc_unicode_version();

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `utf8proc.h` is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is not necessary and can lead to linker errors.
2. The function `utf8proc_init()` is declared as `extern "C"`, but the function `utf8proc_unicode_version()` is not. This can also lead to linker errors.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The header file `utf8proc.h` is included only once, with the `extern "C"` wrapper.
2. The function `utf8proc_unicode_version()` is declared as `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
