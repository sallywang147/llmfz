Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <wx/platinfo.h>

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  wxPlatformInfo pi;
  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
error: undefined reference to `wxPlatformInfo::wxPlatformInfo()'
</error>

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the definition of the `wxPlatformInfo::wxPlatformInfo()` constructor. This is because the header file `wx/platinfo.h` does not include the definition of this constructor. To fix this issue, we need to include the header file that defines the `wxPlatformInfo` class.

The header file that defines the `wxPlatformInfo` class is `wx/platform.h`. We can include this header file by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <wx/platform.h>
```

After adding this line, the code should compile and run without errors.

The fixed code is shown below:

```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <wx/platform.h>
#include <wx/platinfo.h>

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  wxPlatformInfo pi;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
