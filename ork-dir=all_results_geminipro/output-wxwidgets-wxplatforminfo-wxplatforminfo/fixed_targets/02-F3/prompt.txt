Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include "wx/platform.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  wxPlatformInfo info;
  info.wxPlatformInfo();

  return 0;
}
```

The code has the following build issues:

```
error: undefined reference to `wxPlatformInfo::wxPlatformInfo()'
```

The issue is that the `wxPlatformInfo` class is declared in the `wx/platform.h` header, but its definition is not included. To fix this, we need to include the header that defines the `wxPlatformInfo` class. This header is typically called `wx/platforminfo.h`.

The corrected code is:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include "wx/platform.h"
#include "wx/platforminfo.h"

extern "C" {
#include "wx/wx.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  wxPlatformInfo info;
  info.wxPlatformInfo();

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
