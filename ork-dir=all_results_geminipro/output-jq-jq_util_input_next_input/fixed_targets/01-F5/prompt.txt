Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include "jq_util.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct jq_util_input_state state;
  memset(&state, 0, sizeof(state));
  state.data = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  state.len = state.data.size();
  jq_util_input_next_input(&state);
  jq_util_input_free(&state);  // Free the allocated memory.
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `jq_util.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary when using C++ code to call C functions, as it ensures that the C function names are not mangled by the C++ compiler.
2. The `jq_util_input_next_input` and `jq_util_input_free` functions are not declared in the `jq_util.h` header file. This means that the compiler does not know about these functions and will generate an error when trying to compile the code.

To fix these issues, the `jq_util.h` header file should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` and the `jq_util_input_next_input` and `jq_util_input_free` functions should be declared in the header file.

The corrected code is shown above. With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
