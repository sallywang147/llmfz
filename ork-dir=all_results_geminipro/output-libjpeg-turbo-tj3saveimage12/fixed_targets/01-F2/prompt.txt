Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <turbojpeg.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  tjhandle handle = NULL;
  short *buffer = NULL;
  int width = 0, height = 0, pixelFormat = 0, pitch = 0;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  if ((handle = tjInitCompress()) == NULL)
    goto bailout;

  width = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  height = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);
  pixelFormat = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(TJ_GRAY, TJ_BGRX);
  pitch = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(1, 1024);

  if (pixelFormat == TJ_GRAY)
    buffer = (short *)malloc(width * height * sizeof(short));
  else
    buffer = (short *)malloc(width * height * 4 * sizeof(short));

  if (!buffer)
    goto bailout;

  stream.ConsumeData(buffer, width * height * sizeof(short));

  if (tj3SaveImage12(handle, "/dev/null", buffer, width, pitch, height, pixelFormat) == 0)
    goto bailout;

  free(buffer);
  buffer = NULL;

bailout:
  free(buffer);
  if (handle)
    tjDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `tj3SaveImage12` function is declared in the `turbojpeg.h` header file, which is a C header file. When compiling the code with a C++ compiler, the compiler expects the function to be declared with `extern "C"` to ensure that it is compiled as a C function.

To fix the issue, we wrapped the `#include <turbojpeg.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the `tj3SaveImage12` function is declared as a C function. This allowed the compiler to successfully link the function to the code and resolve the undefined reference error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
