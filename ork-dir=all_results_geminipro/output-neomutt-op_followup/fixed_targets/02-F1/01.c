The build error is caused by the missing header file `op_followup.h`, which contains the declaration of the function `op_followup`. To fix the issue, we need to include this header file in the code.

To do this, we wrap the `#include` directive for `op_followup.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because `op_followup.h` is written in C, and we are compiling the code with a C++ compiler. The `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to treat the contents of the header file as C code, which prevents any name mangling that might occur when compiling C++ code.

After adding the `extern "C" {}` directive, the code should compile and run successfully.
