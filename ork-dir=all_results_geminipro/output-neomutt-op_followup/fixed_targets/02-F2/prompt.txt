Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"

extern "C" {
#include "op_followup.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  struct AttachPrivateData* private_data = new struct AttachPrivateData;
  int arg_1 = provider.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  int res = op_followup(private_data, arg_1);

  delete private_data;

  return res;
}
```

The build error is caused by the missing header file `op_followup.h`, which contains the declaration of the function `op_followup`. To fix the issue, we need to include this header file in the code.

To do this, we wrap the `#include` directive for `op_followup.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because `op_followup.h` is written in C, and we are compiling the code with a C++ compiler. The `extern "C"` directive tells the compiler to treat the contents of the header file as C code, which prevents any name mangling that might occur when compiling C++ code.

After adding the `extern "C" {}` directive, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
