Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

extern "C" {
#include "libusb/libusb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct libusb_device_handle *dev_handle = NULL;
  int config = 0;
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  uint8_t bus_number = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();
  uint8_t device_address = stream.ConsumeIntegral<uint8_t>();

  libusb_init(NULL);
  dev_handle = libusb_open_device_with_vid_pid(NULL, bus_number, device_address);
  if (!dev_handle) {
    return 0;
  }

  libusb_get_configuration(dev_handle, &config);

  libusb_close(dev_handle);
  libusb_exit(NULL);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build issue because the `libusb` library is not properly linked. To fix this, the `libusb.h` header must be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the C++ compiler generates the correct linkage information.

The corrected code is shown above.

With this change, the code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
