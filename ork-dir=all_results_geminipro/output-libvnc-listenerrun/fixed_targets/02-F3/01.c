The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `listener.h` is included twice, once with and once without the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is not necessary and can lead to undefined reference errors.
2. The function `listenerRun` is declared as `extern "C"` in the header file `listener.h`, but it is not defined as `extern "C"` in the source file. This can also lead to undefined reference errors.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The second inclusion of `listener.h` has been removed.
2. The function `listenerRun` has been declared as `extern "C"` in the source file.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
