Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" char *listenerRun(char *data);

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  char *input_c_str = const_cast<char *>(input.c_str());
  listenerRun(input_c_str);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'
```

This error occurs because the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is declared in the header file `fuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h`, which is not included in the code. To fix this error, we need to include the header file `fuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h` in the code.

We also need to wrap the `#include` directive for the header file `fuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h` with `extern "C" {}` because the header file is written in C and the rest of the code is written in C++. This is necessary to ensure that the C++ compiler does not mangle the names of the symbols defined in the header file.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
