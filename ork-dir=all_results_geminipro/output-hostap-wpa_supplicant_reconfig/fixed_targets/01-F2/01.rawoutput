The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'wpa_supplicant_reconfig'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `wpa_supplicant_reconfig`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the header file that declares the function is included in the compilation.

The header file that declares `wpa_supplicant_reconfig` is `wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h`, which is already included in the code. However, the header file is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which means that the linker will not be able to find the function definition unless it is also declared with `extern "C"`.

To fix this, we need to remove the `extern "C" {}` wrapper from the `#include` directive for `wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include <wpa_supplicant/hostapd.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int signal = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const std::string signal_ctx = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  wpa_supplicant_reconfig(signal, const_cast<char*>(signal_ctx.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should compile and run successfully.
