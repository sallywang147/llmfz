Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "or.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string config_file = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  struct or_options_t *old_options = options_new();
  if (old_options == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  const int ret = options_act__real(old_options, config_file.c_str());
  options_free(old_options);
  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `or.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the C++ compiler expects the functions in `or.h` to be declared with C linkage, but they are declared with C++ linkage.
2. The function `options_act__real` is not declared in the header file `or.h`. This causes a compiler error because the compiler cannot find the definition of the function.

To fix the code, we need to wrap the `#include` directive for `or.h` with `extern "C" {}` and declare the function `options_act__real` in the header file `or.h`.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
