Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
#include "ihevce_pre_enc_process_frame_thrd.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t context_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0, 1024 * 1024);
  char* context = static_cast<char*>(malloc(context_size));
  stream.ConsumeBytes(context, context_size);
  int ret = ihevce_pre_enc_process_frame_thrd(context, context_size);
  free(context);
  return ret;
}
```

In the original code, the function `ihevce_pre_enc_process_frame_thrd` takes two arguments: `context` and `context_size`. However, in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, the call to `ihevce_pre_enc_process_frame_thrd` only passes one argument: `context`. This causes a build error because the function is not being called with the correct number of arguments.

To fix this, the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function has been modified to pass both the `context` and `context_size` arguments to the `ihevce_pre_enc_process_frame_thrd` function. This ensures that the function is being called with the correct number of arguments and should resolve the build error.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
