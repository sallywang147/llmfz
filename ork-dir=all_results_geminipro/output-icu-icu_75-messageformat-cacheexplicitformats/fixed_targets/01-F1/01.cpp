The original code was missing the `std::string` and `std::cerr` headers, which are necessary for the `std::string` and `std::cerr` objects to be used in the code.

The `std::exception` header is also missing, which is necessary for the `std::exception` object to be used in the catch block.

The `try` and `catch` blocks were also missing, which are necessary for catching the `std::exception` object.

The `formatted` variable was also missing, which is necessary for storing the formatted string.

The `status` variable was also missing, which is necessary for storing the status of the `format()` function.

The `if (U_FAILURE(status))` check was also missing, which is necessary for checking the status of the `format()` function.

The `return EXIT_SUCCESS;` statement was also missing, which is necessary for indicating that the function was successful.
