Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <libexif/exif-data.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libexif/exif-loader.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  // Parse tags using (ultimately) exif_data_load_data()
  ExifData *image = exif_data_new_from_data(data, size);
  if (image) {
    // Exercise the EXIF tag manipulation code
    exif_data_set_byte_order(image, EXIF_BYTE_ORDER_INTEL);
    exif_data_set_byte_order(image, EXIF_BYTE_ORDER_MOTOROLA);
    exif_data_unref(image);
  }

  return 0;
}
```
In this code, the issue was that the `ExifData` type was not defined. To fix this, the `#include <libexif/exif-loader.h>` line was wrapped in `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the `ExifData` type is visible to the C++ compiler.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
