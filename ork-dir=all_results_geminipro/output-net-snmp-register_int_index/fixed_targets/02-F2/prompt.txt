Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'register_int_index'
```

This means that the function `register_int_index` is not defined in the program. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function.

The following is the fixed code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>

#include "register_int_index.h"  // Include the header file that defines register_int_index

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::vector<uint8_t> name_bytes =
      stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(name_len);
  const size_t* name = reinterpret_cast<const size_t*>(name_bytes.data());
  const int val = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  register_int_index(const_cast<size_t*>(name), name_len, val);
  return 0;
}
```

Now, the program should build and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
