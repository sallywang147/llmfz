Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

// Add the necessary header for the missing function
#include <map>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t name_len = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::string name = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(name_len);
  const int val = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  // Fix the function call by using the correct map function
  std::map<size_t, int> name_to_val;
  name_to_val.insert(std::make_pair(reinterpret_cast<size_t*>(const_cast<char*>(name.c_str())),
                     name_len, val));
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `register_int_index` is not defined.
2. The map `name_to_val` is not declared.

To fix the first issue, we need to include the necessary header for the missing function. In this case, the header is `<map>`.

To fix the second issue, we need to declare the map `name_to_val` before using it.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
