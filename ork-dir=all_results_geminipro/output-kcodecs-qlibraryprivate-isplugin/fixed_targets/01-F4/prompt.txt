Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <Qt>
#include <QLibrary>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  QLibrary lib("libQt5Core.so");
  if (!lib.load()) {
    return 0;
  }
  QLibraryPrivate *libPrivate = reinterpret_cast<QLibraryPrivate *>(lib.d_ptr);
  if (libPrivate) {
    libPrivate->isPlugin();
  }
  lib.unload();
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code, we added a check to ensure that the library is successfully loaded before accessing its private data. This prevents the program from crashing due to a null pointer dereference.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
