#include <QLibrary>
#include <QLibraryPrivate>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdbool.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  QLibraryPrivate *lib = new QLibraryPrivate();
  lib->isPlugin(lib);
  delete lib;
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `stdbool.h` header was not included, which is necessary for the `bool` type used in the `QLibraryPrivate::isPlugin` method. To fix this, the `stdbool.h` header is included within an `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that it is properly linked during compilation.
