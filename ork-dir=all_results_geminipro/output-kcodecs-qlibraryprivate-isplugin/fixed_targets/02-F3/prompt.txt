Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <QLibrary>
#include <QLibraryPrivate>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stdbool.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  QLibraryPrivate *lib = new QLibraryPrivate();
  bool is_plugin = lib->isPlugin(lib);
  delete lib;
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `stdbool.h` header was included within an `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that it is properly linked during compilation.
2. The `isPlugin` method was called with `lib` as both the first and second arguments, as required by the method signature.
3. The return value of the `isPlugin` method was stored in a `bool` variable `is_plugin` to avoid a compiler warning.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
