Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "cryptofuzz/component/ECDSA_Signature.h"
#include "cryptofuzz/module/Botan_detail.h"
#include "cryptofuzz/operation/ECDSA_Sign.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  cryptofuzz::operation::ECDSA_Sign ecdsa_sign;
  std::optional<cryptofuzz::component::ECDSA_Signature> signature;
  cryptofuzz::module::Botan_detail::ECxDSA_Sign<Botan::ECGDSA_PrivateKey,
                                             cryptofuzz::operation::ECGDSA_Sign,
                                             false>(&signature, &ecdsa_sign);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the original code:

* Included the missing header file `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h`.
* Removed the `extern "C"` wrapper around the `#include` directive for `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h`. This is because the header file is already written in C++ and does not need to be wrapped in `extern "C"`.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
