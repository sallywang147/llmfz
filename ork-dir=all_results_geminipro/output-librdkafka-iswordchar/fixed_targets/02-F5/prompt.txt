Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cwchar>

extern "C" {
#include <locale>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  int c = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  iswdigit(c);
  return 0;
}

extern "C" int iswdigit(int c) {
  return std::iswdigit(c);
}

extern "C" int iswordchar(int c) {
  return iswdigit(c) || iswalpha(c) || c == '_';
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'iswalpha'
```

This error is caused by the fact that the `iswalpha` function is not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to include the `<cwchar>` header, which defines the `iswalpha` function. We also need to wrap the `#include` directive with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the `iswalpha` function is exported with C linkage.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
