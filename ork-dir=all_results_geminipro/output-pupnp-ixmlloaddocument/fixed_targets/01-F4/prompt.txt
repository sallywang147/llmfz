Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ixml.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 5120

extern "C" {
int CheckXML(char *filename) {

  int rc;
  DOMString s;
  IXML_Document *doc = NULL;

  doc = ixmlLoadDocument(filename);
  if (doc == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  s = ixmlPrintDocument(doc);
  if (s == NULL || s[0] == '\0') {
    ixmlDocument_free(doc);
    return 1;
  }

  ixmlFreeDOMString(s);
  ixmlDocument_free(doc);

  return 0;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  int ret;
  char filename[256];

  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());
  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }

  fwrite(Data, Size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  ret = CheckXML(filename);
  unlink(filename);
  return ret;
}
}

int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. Added a `main` function to the program. This is necessary for the program to be able to run as a standalone executable.
2. Changed the `CheckXML` function to return an `int` value instead of a `void`. This is necessary for the program to be able to return a status code to the operating system.
3. Changed the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to return an `int` value instead of a `void`. This is necessary for the program to be able to return a status code to the fuzzer.
4. Changed the `ixmlLoadDocument` function to return a `IXML_Document*` instead of a `void*`. This is necessary for the program to be able to use the `ixmlPrintDocument` function.
5. Changed the `ixmlPrintDocument` function to return a `DOMString` instead of a `char*`. This is necessary for the program to be able to use the `ixmlFreeDOMString` function.
6. Changed the `ixmlFreeDOMString` function to take a `DOMString` as an argument instead of a `char*`. This is necessary for the program to be able to use the `ixmlPrintDocument` function.
7. Changed the `ixmlDocument_free` function to take a `IXML_Document*` as an argument instead of a `void*`. This is necessary for the program to be able to use the `ixmlLoadDocument` function.
8. Added the necessary `#include` directives for the `ixml` library.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
