Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ixml.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define kMinInputLength 10
#define kMaxInputLength 5120

extern "C" {
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/tree.h>
}

int CheckXML(char *filename) {

  int rc;
  DOMString s;
  IXML_Document *doc = NULL;

  doc = ixmlLoadDocument(filename);
  if (doc == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  s = ixmlPrintDocument(doc);
  if (s == NULL || s[0] == '\0') {
    ixmlDocument_free(doc);
    return 1;
  }

  ixmlFreeDOMString(s);
  ixmlDocument_free(doc);

  return 0;
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {

  if (Size < kMinInputLength || Size > kMaxInputLength) {
    return 1;
  }

  int ret;
  char filename[256];

  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());
  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp) {
    return 0;
  }

  fwrite(Data, Size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  ret = CheckXML(filename);
  unlink(filename);
  return ret;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `ixml.h` header was not included with `extern "C" {}`. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definitions for the functions declared in that header.

To fix this, the `#include "ixml.h"` line was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the header as a C header, which allows the linker to find the definitions for the functions declared in that header.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
