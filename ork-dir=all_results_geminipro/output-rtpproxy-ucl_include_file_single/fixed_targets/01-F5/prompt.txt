Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ucl/ucl.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *data_copy = (char *)malloc(len + 1);
  provider.ConsumeBytes(data_copy, len);
  data_copy[len] = '\0';

  struct ucl_parser *parser = ucl_parser_new(0);
  struct ucl_include_params params = {0};
  params.include_callback = NULL;
  params.user_data = NULL;

  bool result = ucl_include_file_single(data_copy, len, parser, &params);

  free(data_copy);
  ucl_parser_free(parser);

  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The `ucl.h` header is included only once, with `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `include_callback` and `user_data` members of the `ucl_include_params` struct are initialized to `NULL`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
