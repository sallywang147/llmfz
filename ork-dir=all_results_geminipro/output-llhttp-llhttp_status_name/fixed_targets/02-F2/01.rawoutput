The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'llhttp_status_name'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `llhttp_status_name`. To fix this, you need to make sure that the library that contains this function is linked to your program.

In this case, the library is `llhttp`. You can link to it by adding the following line to your code:

```
#include <llhttp.h>
```

You also need to make sure that the `llhttp` library is installed on your system. If it is not, you can install it using your package manager.

Once you have made these changes, the code should build and run without errors.

Here is the fixed code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <llhttp.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  int status_code = data[0] * 256 + data[1];
  data += 4;
  size -= 4;

  char *status_name = llhttp_status_name(status_code);
  if (status_name != NULL) {
    free(status_name);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
