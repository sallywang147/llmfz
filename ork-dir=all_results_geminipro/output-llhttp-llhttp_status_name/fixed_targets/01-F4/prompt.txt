Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "llhttp.h"
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < 4) {
    return 0;
  }
  int status = data[0] | (data[1] << 8) | (data[2] << 16) | (data[3] << 24);
  const char *status_name = llhttp_status_name(status);
  if (status_name != NULL) {
    free((void *)status_name);  // Cast to void* to avoid compiler warning
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
