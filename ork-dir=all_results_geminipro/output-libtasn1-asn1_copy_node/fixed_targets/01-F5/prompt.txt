Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "asn1_fuzz.h"
#include "asn1_parser.h"

extern "C" {
#include "asn1_copy.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct asn1_node_st *dst = asn1_create_node();
  struct asn1_node_st *src = asn1_create_node();

  const std::string dst_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string src_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  asn1_copy_node(dst, const_cast<char*>(dst_name.c_str()), src,
                 const_cast<char*>(src_name.c_str()), NULL, NULL);

  asn1_delete_node(dst);
  asn1_delete_node(src);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the additional two arguments to the `asn1_copy_node` function call, which are `NULL` and `NULL`. These arguments are required by the function declaration, and their values are not used in the function implementation.

The corrected code should build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
