The issue with the original code was that the function `BrotliDecoderTakeOutput` was not called. This function is responsible for consuming the decompressed data from the decoder, and not calling it would result in the decoder's internal buffer becoming full and the decompression process being aborted.

To fix this issue, the line `BrotliDecoderTakeOutput(s, &total_out);` was added after the call to `BrotliDecoderDecompressStream`. This ensures that the decompressed data is consumed and the decoder's internal buffer is kept empty, allowing the decompression process to continue until all the input data has been processed.
