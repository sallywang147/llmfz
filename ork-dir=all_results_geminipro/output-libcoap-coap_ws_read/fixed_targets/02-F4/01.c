The original code had an issue with the inclusion of the `coap_session.h` header. It was wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, but the `#include` directive itself was not. This caused the linker to be unable to find the definition of the `coap_session_t` type, resulting in the build error.

To fix this, the `#include` directive for `coap_session.h` has been moved inside the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the linker can correctly find the definition of the `coap_session_t` type.
