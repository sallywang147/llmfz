Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <jq.h>

extern "C" {
#include <jq.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Initialize jq_state.
  struct jq_state* jq = jq_init();
  if (jq == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Consume size_t x.
  const size_t x = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  // Consume jv_refcnt *y.
  const size_t y_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> y_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(y_size);
  struct jv_refcnt* y = jv_mem_alloc(y_size);
  memcpy(y, y_data.data(), y_size);

  // Consume size_t z.
  const size_t z = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();

  // Consume jv_refcnt *w.
  const size_t w_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> w_data = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(w_size);
  struct jv_refcnt* w = jv_mem_alloc(w_size);
  memcpy(w, w_data.data(), w_size);

  // Call f_min_by_impl.
  f_min_by_impl(jq, x, y, z, w);

  // Clean up.
  jv_free(y);
  jv_free(w);
  jq_teardown(&jq);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The function `f_min_by_impl` is not defined.
2. The header `jq.h` is included twice, once with `extern "C" {}` and once without. This can lead to linker errors.

To fix the first issue, the function `f_min_by_impl` needs to be defined. This can be done by including the necessary header files or by defining the function directly in the code.

To fix the second issue, the header `jq.h` should be included only once, with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the function `f_min_by_impl` is properly linked.

The fixed code includes the necessary header files and includes the header `jq.h` only once, with `extern "C" {}`. This should fix the build errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
