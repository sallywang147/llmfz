Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <auth.h>
#include <libc.h>
#include <libsec.h>
#include <mp.h>
#include <u.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *fuzz_der = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (fuzz_der == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(fuzz_der, data, size);
  fuzz_der[size] = '\0';

  struct Bytes signature;
  struct RSApub pk;
  char *edigest;
  struct Elem *psigalg;
  char *result;

  signature.len = size;
  signature.data = fuzz_der;
  result = verify_signature(&signature, &pk, edigest, &psigalg);
  free(result);

  free(fuzz_der);
  return 0;
}

// Define the missing function verify_signature
char *verify_signature(struct Bytes *signature, struct RSApub *pk, char *edigest, struct Elem *psigalg) {
  // Implement the missing function here
  return NULL;
}
```

The missing function `verify_signature` is defined at the end of the code. This function takes four arguments:

- `signature`: A pointer to a `Bytes` struct, which contains the DER-encoded signature to be verified.
- `pk`: A pointer to a `RSApub` struct, which contains the public key to be used for verification.
- `edigest`: A pointer to a string containing the digest of the message that was signed.
- `psigalg`: A pointer to an `Elem` struct, which contains the signature algorithm that was used.

The function returns a pointer to a string containing the result of the verification, or `NULL` if an error occurred.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
