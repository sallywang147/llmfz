Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <auth.h>
#include <libc.h>
#include <libsec.h>
#include <mp.h>
#include <u.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *fuzz_der = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (fuzz_der == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }
  memcpy(fuzz_der, data, size);
  fuzz_der[size] = '\0';

  struct Bytes signature;
  struct RSApub pk;
  char *edigest;
  struct Elem *psigalg;
  char *result;

  signature.len = size;
  signature.data = fuzz_der;
  result = verify_signature(&signature, &pk, edigest, &psigalg);
  free(result);

  free(fuzz_der);
  return 0;
}
```

The build issues in this code are caused by the inclusion of C headers in a C++ program. To fix this, the header inclusion lines for the C headers (`<auth.h>`, `<libc.h>`, `<libsec.h>`, `<mp.h>`, and `<u.h>`) are wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the included headers as C headers, rather than C++ headers.

The corrected code includes the necessary headers and wraps the C header inclusions with `extern "C" {}`, which resolves the build issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
