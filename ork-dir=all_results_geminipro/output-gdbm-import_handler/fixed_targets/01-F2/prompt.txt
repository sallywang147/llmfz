Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "command.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct command_param param;
  param.param = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  param.val = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));

  struct command_environ cenv;
  cenv.cenv = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));

  import_handler(&param, &cenv);

  return 0;
}
```

The build error is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'import_handler'
```

This error occurs because the `import_handler` function is declared in the `command.h` header file, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are included in the build. To fix this error, you need to define the `import_handler` function in a source file that is included in the build.

In this case, the `import_handler` function is defined in the `command.c` file. So, you need to add the following line to the top of the `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```
add_subdirectory(command)
```

This will add the `command` subdirectory to the build, which will include the `command.c` file and define the `import_handler` function.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
