```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "command.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdio.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  struct command_param param;
  param.param = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  param.val = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));

  struct command_environ cenv;
  cenv.cenv = stream.ConsumeBytes<char>(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));

  import_handler(&param, &cenv);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `import_handler` function is declared in the `command.h` header file, but it is not defined in any of the source files that are included in the build.
2. The `command.c` file, which defines the `import_handler` function, is not included in the build.

To fix these issues, you need to:

1. Add the following line to the top of the `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```
add_subdirectory(command)
```

This will add the `command` subdirectory to the build, which will include the `command.c` file and define the `import_handler` function.

2. Add the following line to the `command.h` header file:

```
extern "C" void import_handler(struct command_param*, struct command_environ*);
```

This will declare the `import_handler` function as an extern "C" function, which will allow it to be called from the C++ code.

With these changes, the code should build and run successfully.
