Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "command.h"

extern "C" {
#include "import_handler.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct command_param param = {0};
  struct command_environ cenv = {0};
  param.param = (char*)stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str();

  import_handler(&param, &cenv);
  return 0;
}
```

The code was missing the necessary header files for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class and the `ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString()` method. To fix the issue, the following header files were included:

```cpp
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>
```

Additionally, the `ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString()` method is part of the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, so the following line was added to the code:

```cpp
FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
