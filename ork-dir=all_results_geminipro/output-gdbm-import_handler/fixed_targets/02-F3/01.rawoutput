```cpp
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "command.h"

extern "C" {
#include "import_handler.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct command_param param = {0};
  struct command_environ cenv = {0};
  param.param = (char*)stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString().c_str();

  import_handler(&param, &cenv);
  return 0;
}
```

The code was missing the necessary header files for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class and the `ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString()` method. To fix the issue, the following header files were included:

```cpp
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>
```

Additionally, the `ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString()` method is part of the `FuzzedDataProvider` class, so the following line was added to the code:

```cpp
FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.
