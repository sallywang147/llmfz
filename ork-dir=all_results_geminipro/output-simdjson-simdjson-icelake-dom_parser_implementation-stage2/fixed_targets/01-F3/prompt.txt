Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

#include "FuzzUtils.h"
#include "NullBuffer.h"
#include "simdjson.h"

extern "C" {
#include "simdjson/dom/parser_implementation.h"
#include "simdjson/icelake/dom_parser_implementation.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  FuzzData fd(Data, Size);

  simdjson::fallback::dom_parser_implementation parser;
  simdjson::dom::document doc;
  simdjson_unused auto error = parser.stage1(doc, fd.data(), fd.size());
  if (error)
    return 0;

  simdjson_unused auto res = simdjson::icelake::dom_parser_implementation::stage2(&parser, &doc);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `#include` directive for `simdjson/dom/parser_implementation.h` and `simdjson/icelake/dom_parser_implementation.h` is missing the `extern "C"` wrapper. This is necessary because these headers contain C++ code that needs to be accessible to the C function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.

2. The `simdjson_unused` macro is not defined. This macro is used to suppress compiler warnings about unused variables.

To fix these issues, the following changes have been made:

1. The `#include` directives for `simdjson/dom/parser_implementation.h` and `simdjson/icelake/dom_parser_implementation.h` have been wrapped with `extern "C"`.

2. The `simdjson_unused` macro has been defined as `static inline`.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
