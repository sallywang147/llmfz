Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

extern "C" {
#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  gnutls_session_t session;
  gnutls_init(&session, GNUTLS_SERVER);
  gnutls_priority_set_direct(&session, "NORMAL", NULL);

  gnutls_certificate_credentials_t x509_cred;
  gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials(&x509_cred);

  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust(&x509_cred);
  gnutls_credentials_set(session, GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE, x509_cred);

  gnutls_dh_params_t dh_params;
  gnutls_dh_params_init(&dh_params);
  gnutls_dh_params_generate2(dh_params, 2048);
  gnutls_dh_set_params(session, dh_params);
  gnutls_dh_params_deinit(dh_params);

  gnutls_rsa_key_t rsa_key;
  gnutls_rsa_key_init(&rsa_key);
  gnutls_rsa_generate_key(&rsa_key, 2048, 65537);
  gnutls_rsa_set_key(session, GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_RSA, &rsa_key);
  gnutls_rsa_key_deinit(&rsa_key);

  struct mbuffer_st *packet = nullptr;
  size_t packet_size = gnutls_record_recv_packet(&session, &packet);
  if (packet_size > 0) {
    gnutls_record_release_packet(&session, &packet);
  }

  gnutls_bye(&session, GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR);
  gnutls_deinit(&session);

  gnutls_certificate_free_credentials(x509_cred);

  return 0;
}
```

The corrected code includes the necessary `gnutls/gnutls.h` header file within the `extern "C" {}` block, ensuring that the `gnutls_record_recv_packet` function is declared in the correct scope.

The original code had the following issues:

1. The `gnutls/gnutls.h` header file was not included within the `extern "C" {}` block, which meant that the `gnutls_record_recv_packet` function was not declared in the scope of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.
2. The `gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials` function was not declared in the scope of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

To fix these issues, the `gnutls/gnutls.h` header file was included within the `extern "C" {}` block, and the `gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials` function was declared using `extern "C"`.

With these corrections, the code should compile successfully and run as expected.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
