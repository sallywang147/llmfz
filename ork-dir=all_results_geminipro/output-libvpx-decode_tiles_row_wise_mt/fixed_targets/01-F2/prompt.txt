Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <libavif/avif.h>
}

extern "C" char* decode_tiles_row_wise_mt(struct VP9Decoder*, char*, char*);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  struct VP9Decoder* decoder = new VP9Decoder();

  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);

  size_t first_buffer_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1<<20);
  std::vector<uint8_t> first_buffer(first_buffer_size);
  provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(first_buffer.data(), first_buffer_size);

  size_t second_buffer_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1<<20);
  std::vector<uint8_t> second_buffer(second_buffer_size);
  provider.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(second_buffer.data(), second_buffer_size);

  char* result = decode_tiles_row_wise_mt(decoder, reinterpret_cast<char*>(first_buffer.data()), reinterpret_cast<char*>(second_buffer.data()));

  delete decoder;

  return 0;
}
```

The code was missing the header file `libavif/avif.h` which contains the declaration of the `decode_tiles_row_wise_mt` function. The `extern "C" {}` block was added to wrap the `#include` directive of this header file, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
