Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "brotli/encode.h"

extern "C" {
#include "brotli/decode.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int quality = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int lgwin = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int block_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const size_t input_size = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  const std::string input = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  size_t output_size = 0;
  char* output = nullptr;
  BrotliEncoderCompress(quality, lgwin, block_size, input_size,
                        reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(input.c_str()), &output_size,
                        &output);
  free(output);
  return 0;
}
```

The provided C++ code has the following issues:

- The `BrotliEncoderCompress` function is declared in the `brotli/encode.h` header, but the header is not included in the code.

To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include "brotli/encode.h"
```

- The `BrotliEncoderCompress` function is declared with the `extern "C"` linkage, but the function definition is not wrapped with `extern "C"`.

To fix this, add the `extern "C"` linkage to the function definition:

```c++
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  // ...
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
