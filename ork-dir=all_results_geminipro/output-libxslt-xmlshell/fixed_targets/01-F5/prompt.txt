Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "libxml/parser.h"
#include "libxml/tree.h"

extern "C" {
#include "libxml/xpath.h"
#include "libxml/xmlschemastypes.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  xmlDocPtr doc = xmlParseFile(filename.c_str());
  if (doc == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  xmlShellCmd(doc, const_cast<char*>(filename.c_str()), nullptr, nullptr);

  xmlFreeDoc(doc);
  xmlCleanupParser();
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'xmlShellCmd'
```

This error is caused by the fact that the function `xmlShellCmd` is not declared in any of the included header files. To fix this, we need to include the header file that declares this function, which is `libxml/xpath.h`.

We also need to include the header file `libxml/xmlschemastypes.h` because it is required by `libxml/xpath.h`.

We need to wrap the `#include` directives for these header files with `extern "C" {}` because they are written in C and not C++. This is necessary to ensure that the linker can find the definitions of the functions and variables declared in these header files.

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
