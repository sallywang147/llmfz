Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

#include "speex/speex.h"

extern "C" {
#include "speex/speex_nb.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  const size_t state_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* state = new char[state_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(state, state_size);

  const size_t vin_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char* vin = new char[vin_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(vin, vin_size);

  SpeexBits bits;
  speex_bits_init(&bits);

  int ret = nb_encode(state, vin, &bits);
  if (ret != 0) {
    speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
    delete[] state;
    delete[] vin;
    return 0;
  }

  speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
  delete[] state;
  delete[] vin;
  return 0;
}
```

The issue here is that the `nb_encode` function is defined in the `speex_nb.h` header, which is not included in the original code. To fix this, we need to include the `speex_nb.h` header inside an `extern "C" {}` block. This is because the `speex_nb.h` header contains C functions, and we need to use the `extern "C"` directive to ensure that they are properly linked with the C++ code.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
