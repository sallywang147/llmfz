Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

#include "speex/speex.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t state_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0, 1 << 10);
  char* state = new char[state_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(state, state_size);

  const size_t vin_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0, 1 << 10);
  char* vin = new char[vin_size];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(vin, vin_size);

  SpeexBits bits;
  speex_bits_init(&bits);
  nb_encode(state, vin, &bits);
  speex_bits_destroy(&bits);

  delete[] state;
  delete[] vin;
  return 0;
}
```

The original code is missing the `nb_encode` function declaration. To fix this, the following line should be added to the beginning of the code:

```c++
extern "C" void nb_encode(void* state, void* vin, SpeexBits* bits);
```

Additionally, the `speex_bits_init` and `speex_bits_destroy` functions are declared in the `speex/speex.h` header file, which is included in the code. However, the `nb_encode` function is declared in a separate header file, `speex/speex_nb.h`. To fix this, the following line should be added to the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include "speex/speex_nb.h"
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
