Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

#include "protobuf-c.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  struct ProtobufCBuffer buffer;
  protobuf_c_buffer_init(&buffer, 0, NULL);

  // Initialize a field descriptor.
  struct ProtobufCFieldDescriptor field;
  memset(&field, 0, sizeof(field));
  field.label = PROTOBUF_C_LABEL_OPTIONAL;
  field.type = PROTOBUF_C_TYPE_INT32;
  field.name = (char*)"test_field";

  // Initialize a member variable.
  int32_t member = 0;

  // Call the function to be fuzzed.
  size_t packed_size = optional_field_pack_to_buffer(&field, 1, (char*)&member, &buffer);

  // Free the buffer.
  protobuf_c_buffer_fini(&buffer);

  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
