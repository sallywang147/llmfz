Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <exception>

extern "C" {
#include "piex.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::exception *exception = nullptr;
  int *int_ptr = nullptr;

  try {
    piex_func(&exception, &int_ptr);
  } catch (...) {
    // Handle the exception here
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added `#include <exception>` to include the necessary header for handling exceptions.
2. Added a `catch (...)` block to catch and handle any exceptions that may be thrown by `piex_func`. This ensures that the fuzzer will not crash if an exception is thrown.

The original code had a build error because it was missing the necessary header for handling exceptions (`#include <exception>`). Additionally, it was not handling exceptions that may be thrown by `piex_func`, which could cause the fuzzer to crash. The fixed code addresses both of these issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
