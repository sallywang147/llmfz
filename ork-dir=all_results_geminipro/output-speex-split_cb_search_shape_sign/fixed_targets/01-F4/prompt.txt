Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The provided code has no build issues. It includes all the necessary headers and function definitions. The error message is not provided, so it's not possible to determine the exact issue.

Therefore, there is no need to fix the code.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
The target function `void split_cb_search_shape_sign(float * target, float * ak, float * awk1, float * awk2, char * par, int p, int nsf, float * exc, float * r, struct SpeexBits * bits, char * stack, int complexity, int update_target)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void split_cb_search_shape_sign(float * target, float * ak, float * awk1, float * awk2, char * par, int p, int nsf, float * exc, float * r, struct SpeexBits * bits, char * stack, int complexity, int update_target)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
