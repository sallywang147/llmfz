The original code was missing the definition for the function `split_cb_search_shape_sign`. This function is declared in the header file `speex/speex_preprocess.h`, which is included in the code with `#include "speex/speex_preprocess.h"`. However, the function definition is not included in the code, so the linker cannot find it when trying to build the program.

To fix this issue, the header file `speex/speex_preprocess.h` needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to allow the linker to find the function definition. This is done by adding the following lines before the `#include` directive for `speex/speex_preprocess.h`:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include "speex/speex_preprocess.h"
}
```

With this change, the linker will be able to find the definition for `split_cb_search_shape_sign` and the program will build successfully.
