Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "speex/speex.h"
#include "speex/speex_bits.h"

extern "C" {
#include "speex/speex_preprocess.h"
}

void LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  SpeexBits bits;
  speex_bits_init(&bits);
  speex_bits_read_from(&bits, data, size);

  int nsf = 10;
  int p = 1;
  int complexity = 1;
  int update_target = 1;
  float exc[10] = {0};
  float r[10] = {0};
  float target[10] = {0};
  float ak[10] = {0};
  float awk1[10] = {0};
  float awk2[10] = {0};
  char par[10] = {0};
  char stack[1000] = {0};

  split_cb_search_shape_sign(target, ak, awk1, awk2, par, p, nsf, exc, r, &bits, stack, complexity, update_target);

  speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
}
```

The original code was missing the definition for the function `split_cb_search_shape_sign`. This function is declared in the header file `speex/speex_preprocess.h`, which is included in the code with `#include "speex/speex_preprocess.h"`. However, the function definition is not included in the code, so the linker cannot find it when trying to build the program.

To fix this issue, the header file `speex/speex_preprocess.h` needs to be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to allow the linker to find the function definition. This is done by adding the following lines before the `#include` directive for `speex/speex_preprocess.h`:

```c++
extern "C" {
#include "speex/speex_preprocess.h"
}
```

With this change, the linker will be able to find the definition for `split_cb_search_shape_sign` and the program will build successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
