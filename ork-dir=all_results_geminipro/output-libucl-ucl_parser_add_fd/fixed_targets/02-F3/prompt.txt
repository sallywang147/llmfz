Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ucl.h"
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // If size is 0 we need a null-terminated string.
  // We dont null-terminate the string and by the design
  // of the API passing 0 as size with non null-terminated string
  // gives undefined behavior.
  if (size == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  struct ucl_parser *parser;
  parser = ucl_parser_new(0);

  int fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY);
  if (fd < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  bool result = ucl_parser_add_fd(parser, fd);
  close(fd);

  if (ucl_parser_get_error(parser) != NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  ucl_parser_free(parser);
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:
1. Include the necessary header file `libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h` within the `extern "C" {}` block. This is required to resolve the undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
2. Wrap the `#include` directive for `libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary to ensure that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` is exported with C linkage, which is required for the object linking to succeed.

With these changes, the code should compile and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
