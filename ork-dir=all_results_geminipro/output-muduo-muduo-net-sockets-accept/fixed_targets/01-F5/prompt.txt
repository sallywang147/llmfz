Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  struct sockaddr_in6 addr;
  memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
  addr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
  addr.sin6_port = htons(80);

  // Fix the issue by replacing `muduo::net::sockets::accept4` with `::accept4`.
  int fd = ::accept4(0, &addr, nullptr, SOCK_STREAM);
  if (fd >= 0) {
    close(fd);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code uses `muduo::net::sockets::accept4` to accept a connection on a socket. However, this function is not part of the standard C library and is not available in the `sys/socket.h` header. To fix this, we replace `muduo::net::sockets::accept4` with `::accept4`, which is the standard C function for accepting a connection on a socket.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
