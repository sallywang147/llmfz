Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "muduo/net/sockets.h"

extern "C" {
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  struct sockaddr_in6 addr;
  memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
  addr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
  addr.sin6_port = htons(80);

  int fd = muduo::net::sockets::accept4(0, &addr, nullptr, SOCK_STREAM);
  if (fd >= 0) {
    close(fd);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The build error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'accept4'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the `accept4` function. To fix this, we need to include the header file that defines this function. In this case, the header file is `<sys/socket.h>`. However, this header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary for the object linking to succeed. To fix this, we need to wrap the `#include <sys/socket.h>` directive with `extern "C" {}`.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
