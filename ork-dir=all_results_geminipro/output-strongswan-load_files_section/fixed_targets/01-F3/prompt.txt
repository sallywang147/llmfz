Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <lib/settings.h>

extern "C" {
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct private_settings_t *this = new struct private_settings_t;
  size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> pattern = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(len);
  bool merge = stream.ConsumeBool();
  len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> key = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(len);
  bool ret = load_files_section(this, (char*)pattern.data(), merge, (char*)key.data());
  delete this;
  return 0;
}
```
The code above is correct and should compile without errors. The issue was that the `load_files_section` function was not declared in the code. To fix this, the `lib/settings.h` header file should be included, which contains the declaration of the `load_files_section` function.

The corrected code includes the necessary header file and should compile without errors:
```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <lib/settings.h>

extern "C" {
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  struct private_settings_t *this = new struct private_settings_t;
  size_t len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> pattern = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(len);
  bool merge = stream.ConsumeBool();
  len = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024);
  std::vector<uint8_t> key = stream.ConsumeBytes<uint8_t>(len);
  bool ret = load_files_section(this, (char*)pattern.data(), merge, (char*)key.data());
  delete this;
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
