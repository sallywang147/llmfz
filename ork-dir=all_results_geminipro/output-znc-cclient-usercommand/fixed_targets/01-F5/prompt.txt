Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>

extern "C" {
#include <znc/IRCNetwork.h>
#include <znc/User.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  CClient client;
  CIRCNetwork network(NULL);
  CUser user(NULL, &network);
  client.SetIRCNetwork(&network);
  client.SetUser(&user);
  client.UserCommand(NULL, input);
  return 0;
}
```

Here's the explanation of the changes:

1. We included the necessary headers for `CIRCNetwork` and `CUser`.
2. We set the IRC network and user for the client before calling `UserCommand`. This ensures that the client is properly initialized and can successfully execute user commands.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
