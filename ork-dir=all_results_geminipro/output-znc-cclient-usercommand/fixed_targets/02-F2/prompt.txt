Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <znc/Client.h>

extern "C" {
#include <znc/ZNC.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  std::string input(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size);
  CClient client;
  client.UserCommand(input);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the necessary #include directive for `znc/ZNC.h`, which is required for the `CClient` class to be fully defined. The corrected code includes this header within an `extern "C" {}` block to ensure that the C++ symbols are properly exported for the fuzzer to link against.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
