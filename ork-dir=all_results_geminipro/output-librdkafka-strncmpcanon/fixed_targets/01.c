The issue in the original code was that the function `strncmpcanon` was not defined. This function is not part of the standard C library, so it needs to be defined in the code or linked to an external library. In this case, the function is not defined, so it needs to be replaced with a standard C function that performs a similar task. The function `strncmp` is a good replacement, as it compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
