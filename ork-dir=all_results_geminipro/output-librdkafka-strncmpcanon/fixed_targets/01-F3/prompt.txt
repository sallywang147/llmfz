Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstring>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <string.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  size_t a_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  size_t b_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  size_t n = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1000);
  char* a = new char[a_size + 1];
  char* b = new char[b_size + 1];
  stream.ConsumeBytes(a, a_size);
  stream.ConsumeBytes(b, b_size);
  a[a_size] = '\0';
  b[b_size] = '\0';
  int result = strncmpcanon(a, b, n);
  delete[] a;
  delete[] b;
  return result;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

1. The header file `<string.h>` was wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the linker can find the definition of the `strncmpcanon` function.
2. The `strncmpcanon` function was declared using the `extern "C"` keyword to indicate that it is a C function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
