The provided code is already correct and does not contain any build issues. Therefore, no fixes are needed.

The original code:
```cpp
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libgd/gd.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <gd.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::vector<uint8_t> bytes = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytes();
  FILE* file = fmemopen(bytes.data(), bytes.size(), "rb");
  if (file == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  gdImagePtr image = gdImageCreateFromBmp(file);
  if (image == nullptr) {
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
  }
  gdImageDestroy(image);
  fclose(file);
  return 0;
}
```

This code is a fuzzer that takes a BMP image as input and attempts to parse it using the libgd library. The fuzzer uses the FuzzedDataProvider class from the fuzzer library to generate random BMP images. The code includes the necessary headers for the fuzzer and libgd libraries, and it defines an extern "C" block to include the gd.h header from libgd. The LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput function is the entry point for the fuzzer, and it takes a pointer to a buffer of data and the size of the buffer as input. The function uses the FuzzedDataProvider class to generate a random BMP image and then attempts to parse it using the gdImageCreateFromBmp function from libgd. If the image is successfully parsed, it is destroyed and the file is closed. Otherwise, the file is closed and the function returns 0.

This code is correct and should not produce any build errors.
