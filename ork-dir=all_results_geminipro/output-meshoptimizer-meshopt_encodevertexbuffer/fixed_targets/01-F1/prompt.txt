Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "../src/meshoptimizer.h"

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void fuzzEncoder(const uint8_t *data, size_t size, size_t stride, int (*encode)(void *, size_t, const void *, size_t, size_t)) {
  size_t count = 66; // must be divisible by 3 for decodeIndexBuffer; should be >=64 to cover large vertex blocks

  void *vertices = malloc(count * stride);
  assert(vertices);

  size_t buffer_size = 1024;
  void *buffer = malloc(buffer_size);
  assert(buffer);

  size_t result = encode(buffer, buffer_size, vertices, count, stride);

  free(buffer);
  free(vertices);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  // encodeVertexBuffer supports any strides divisible by 4 in 4-256 interval
  // It's a waste of time to check all of them, so we'll just check a few with different alignment mod 16
  fuzzEncoder(data, size, 4, meshopt_encodeVertexBuffer);
  fuzzEncoder(data, size, 16, meshopt_encodeVertexBuffer);
  fuzzEncoder(data, size, 24, meshopt_encodeVertexBuffer);
  fuzzEncoder(data, size, 32, meshopt_encodeVertexBuffer);

  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
