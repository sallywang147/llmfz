Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

#include "Firestore/core/src/core/query.h"

extern "C" {
#include "Firestore/core/src/util/hashing.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  const char *str_ptr = reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data);
  std::string str{str_ptr, size};
  firebase::firestore::core::Query query;
  if (!query.ParseFromString(str)) {
    return 0;  // Skip invalid inputs.
  }

  size_t hash = firebase::firestore::core::util::Hash(&query);
  (void)hash;  // silence unused variable warning
  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added a check to skip invalid inputs before calling `Hash`. This prevents the fuzzer from crashing on invalid inputs.

2. Wrapped the `#include` directive for `Firestore/core/src/util/hashing.h` with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the header file contains C++ code that needs to be compiled as C code for the fuzzer to work correctly.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
