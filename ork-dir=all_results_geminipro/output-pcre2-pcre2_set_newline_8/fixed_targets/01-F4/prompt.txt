Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

#include "pcre2.h"

#include <pcre2posix.h>

extern "C" {
#include <pcre2posix.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  pcre2_real_compile_context_8* ccontext =
      pcre2_compile_context_create_8(nullptr);
  if (ccontext == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  const int newline = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  const int result = pcre2_set_newline_8(ccontext, newline);
  if (result != 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  pcre2_compile_context_free_8(ccontext);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a build issue because the header file `pcre2posix.h` is included twice. The first inclusion is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is correct. However, the second inclusion is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which causes the build error.

To fix the issue, we need to wrap the second inclusion of `pcre2posix.h` with `extern "C" {}`. The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
