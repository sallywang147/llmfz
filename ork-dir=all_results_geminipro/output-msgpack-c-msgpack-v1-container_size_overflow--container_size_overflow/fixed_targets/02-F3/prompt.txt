Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <msgpack.hpp>
#include <exception>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  try {
    // NOTE(derwolfe): by default the limits are set at 2^32-1 length. I'm
    // setting these at far smaller values to avoid OOMs
    const int test_limit = 1000;
    msgpack::object_handle unpacked = msgpack::unpack(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size, MSGPACK_NULLPTR, MSGPACK_NULLPTR, msgpack::unpack_limit(test_limit, test_limit, test_limit, test_limit, test_limit, test_limit));
    msgpack::sbuffer sbuf;
    msgpack::pack(sbuf, unpacked.get());
    msgpack::v1::container_size_overflow e(sbuf.size());
    throw e;
  } catch (msgpack::v1::container_size_overflow &e) {
    // Fix: Destruct the exception object properly
    e.~container_size_overflow();
  } catch (std::exception &e) {
  } catch (...) {
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the `msgpack::v1::container_size_overflow` exception was not being properly destructed in the `catch` block. This led to a memory leak and the build error.

To fix this, the destructor for `msgpack::v1::container_size_overflow` is explicitly called in the `catch` block using `e.~container_size_overflow()`. This ensures that the exception object is properly destructed and the memory leak is avoided.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
