Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <ArduinoJson.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::BoundedReader<unsigned char const*, void> reader(data, size);
  ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::MsgPackDeserializer<ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::BoundedReader<unsigned char const*, void> > deserializer(reader);
  deserializer.~MsgPackDeserializer();  // Fix: Use the correct destructor syntax
  return 0;
}
```

The issue in the original code was that the destructor of `deserializer` was called incorrectly. The correct syntax for calling a destructor in C++ is `object.~ClassName()`, where `object` is the object to be destroyed and `ClassName` is the name of the class. In the original code, the destructor was called as `ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::MsgPackDeserializer<ArduinoJson::V701HB4::detail::BoundedReader<unsigned char const*, void> >::~MsgPackDeserializer(&deserializer)`, which is incorrect.

The fixed code uses the correct destructor syntax `deserializer.~MsgPackDeserializer()`, which correctly destroys the `deserializer` object.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
