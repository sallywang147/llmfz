Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "libcue.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct Cdtext *cdtext = cdtext_parse(data, size);
  if (!cdtext) {
    return 0;
  }
  cdtext_dump(cdtext, 0);
  cdtext_free(cdtext);
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that it includes the LLVM CommandLine library without wrapping it in `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linking error because the C++ compiler expects C++ symbols, but the LLVM CommandLine library contains C symbols.

To fix the issue, we wrap the `#include` directive for the LLVM CommandLine library in `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler to treat the symbols in the library as C symbols, which resolves the linking error.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
