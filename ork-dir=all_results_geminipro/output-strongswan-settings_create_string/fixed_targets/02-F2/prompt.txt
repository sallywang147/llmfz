Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <liboqs/settings.h>

extern "C" {
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct settings_t *settings;
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  size_t settings_len = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(0, 1024);
  char *settings_str = provider.ConsumeBytesAsString(settings_len).c_str();
  settings = settings_create_string(settings_str);
  settings_destroy(settings);
  return 0;
}
```

The build error was caused by the missing `#include` directive for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class.

To fix this, we added the following line at the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
```

We also wrapped the `#include` directive for the `FuzzedDataProvider` class with `extern "C" {}` to ensure that the function is exported with C linkage.

This is necessary because the `FuzzedDataProvider` class is defined in a C++ library, and the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is defined in a C program.

Without the `extern "C" {}` wrapper, the linker would not be able to find the `FuzzedDataProvider` class when trying to resolve the symbols in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
