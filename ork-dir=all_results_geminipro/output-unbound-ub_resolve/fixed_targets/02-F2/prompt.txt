Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h"
#include "unbound/unbound.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Extract integral values
  int rrtype = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  int rrclass = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();

  // Extract a string. You MUST use `.c_str()` to use result as pointer
  std::string name = stream.ConsumeBytesAsString(stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange(0, 1024));
  char *name_ptr = name.c_str();

  // Extract to user defined object
  struct ub_ctx *ctx = ub_ctx_create();

  // Call the function to fuzz
  struct ub_result *result;
  int ret = ub_resolve(ctx, name_ptr, rrtype, rrclass, &result);

  ub_ctx_delete(ctx);
  ub_resolve_free(result);

  return ret;
}
```

The following changes were made to fix the code:

- Added the `extern "C" {}` wrapper around the `#include "unbound/unbound.h"` directive. This is necessary because the `unbound.h` header file contains C function declarations, and the C++ compiler needs to be able to find these declarations in order to link the program correctly.

- Changed the `ub_resolve()` function call to pass the `name_ptr` variable as the third argument, instead of the `name` variable. This is necessary because the `ub_resolve()` function expects a pointer to a character array as its third argument, and the `name` variable is a `std::string` object.

- Added the `#include <string>` directive to the top of the file. This is necessary because the `std::string` class is used in the program.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
