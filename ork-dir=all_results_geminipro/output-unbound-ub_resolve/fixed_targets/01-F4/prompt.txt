Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "unbound.h"

extern "C" {
#include <libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  struct ub_ctx *ctx;
  struct ub_result *result;
  char *name;
  int rrtype;
  int rrclass;

  if (size < 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  ctx = ub_ctx_create();
  name = (char *)malloc(size);
  memcpy(name, data, size);
  rrtype = data[size - 1];
  rrclass = data[size - 2];
  ub_resolve(ctx, name, rrtype, rrclass, &result);
  ub_resolve_free(result);
  ub_ctx_delete(ctx);
  free(name);
  return 0;
}
```
In the original code, the `ub_resolve()` function returns a pointer to a `ub_result` struct, but the code does not free the allocated memory for the result. This leads to a memory leak. To fix this, the `ub_resolve_free()` function should be called to free the allocated memory.

Additionally, the original code does not include the necessary header file for the `ub_resolve_free()` function. To fix this, the following line should be added to the top of the file:

```c++
#include <unbound.h>
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
