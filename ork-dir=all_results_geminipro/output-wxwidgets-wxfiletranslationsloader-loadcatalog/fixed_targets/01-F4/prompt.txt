Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include "wx/apptrait.h"
#include "wx/intl.h"
#include "wx/log.h"
#include "wx/mstream.h"
#include "wx/translation.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    wxInitialize();
    initialized = true;
  }

  wxLogNull noLog;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string domain = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::string lang = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  wxFileTranslationsLoader loader;
  wxMsgCatalog* catalog = loader.LoadCatalog(nullptr, &domain, &lang);
  if (catalog) {
    delete catalog;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to `wxInitialize'
```

This error means that the linker cannot find the definition of the `wxInitialize` function. This is because the `wxInitialize` function is declared in the `wx/apptrait.h` header file, but the `wx/apptrait.h` header file is not included in the source code.

To fix this error, you need to add the following line to the top of the source code:

```
#include "wx/apptrait.h"
```

This will include the `wx/apptrait.h` header file and make the `wxInitialize` function available to the linker.

Once you have added this line, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
