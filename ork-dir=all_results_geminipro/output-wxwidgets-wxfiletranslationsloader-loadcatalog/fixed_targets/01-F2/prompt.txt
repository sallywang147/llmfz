Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "wx/apptrait.h"
#include "wx/intl.h"
#include "wx/log.h"
#include "wx/mstream.h"
#include "wx/translation.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    wxInitialize();
    initialized = true;
  }

  wxLogNull noLog;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  std::string domain = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  std::string lang = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  wxFileTranslationsLoader loader;
  wxMsgCatalog* catalog = loader.LoadCatalog(nullptr, &domain, &lang);
  if (catalog) {
    delete catalog;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `#include` directives for the wxWidgets headers were not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`, which is necessary when using C++ code in a C context.

To fix the code, the `#include` directives for the wxWidgets headers were wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This ensures that the C compiler will not try to mangle the names of the wxWidgets symbols, which would cause the linker to fail to find them.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
