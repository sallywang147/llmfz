Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "muduo/net/sockets.h"

extern "C" {
#include "llvm/FuzzMutator.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(int)) {
    return 0;
  }
  int fd = *(int *)data;
  if (muduo::net::sockets::isSelfConnect(fd)) {
    // Do something
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a few issues:

1. The `muduo::net::sockets::isSelfConnect` function is not defined.
2. The `muduo::net::sockets` namespace is not declared.

To fix the first issue, we need to include the header file that defines the `isSelfConnect` function. In this case, it is `muduo/net/sockets.h`.

To fix the second issue, we need to declare the `muduo::net::sockets` namespace. This can be done by adding the following line to the top of the file:

```c++
namespace muduo { namespace net { namespace sockets {
```

The corrected code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
