```c++
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include "muduo/net/sockets.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size < sizeof(int)) {
    return 0;
  }
  int fd = *(int *)data;
  muduo::net::sockets::isSelfConnect(fd);
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has a potential buffer overflow issue, as it assumes that the input data is always at least as large as an integer. To fix this, we added a check to ensure that the input data is large enough to hold an integer before dereferencing it.
