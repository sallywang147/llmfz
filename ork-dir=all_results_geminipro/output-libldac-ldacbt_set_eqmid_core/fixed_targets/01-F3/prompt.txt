Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "ldacBT.h"
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

extern "C" {
#include <ldacBT_api.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  HANDLE_LDAC_BT handle_ldac_bt = ldacBT_get_handle();
  ldacBT_set_eqmid_core(handle_ldac_bt, stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>());
  ldacBT_free_handle(handle_ldac_bt);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header file `ldacBT.h` is not included.
2. The function `ldacBT_get_handle()` is not declared in the header file `ldacBT_api.h`.

To fix the code, we need to:

1. Include the header file `ldacBT.h`.
2. Declare the function `ldacBT_get_handle()` in the header file `ldacBT_api.h`.

The fixed code is shown above.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
