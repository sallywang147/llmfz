Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libdwarf.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  Dwfl_Thread *thread = dwfl_thread_init(NULL, NULL, 0);
  if (thread == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  int callback(Dwfl_Module *mod, Dwfl_Func *func, void *arg) {
    (void)mod;
    (void)func;
    (void)arg;
    return 0;
  };

  dwfl_thread_getframes(thread, callback, NULL);

  dwfl_thread_destroy(thread);

  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:

```
error: expected expression before ‘;’ token
```

This error is caused by the use of a lambda expression in the `dwfl_thread_getframes` function. Lambda expressions are not supported in C++.

To fix this error, we have changed the lambda expression to a regular function named `callback`. The `callback` function takes three arguments: `Dwfl_Module *mod`, `Dwfl_Func *func`, and `void *arg`. The function returns an integer.

The `dwfl_thread_getframes` function now calls the `callback` function for each frame in the thread. The `callback` function does nothing, but it could be used to print information about each frame.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
