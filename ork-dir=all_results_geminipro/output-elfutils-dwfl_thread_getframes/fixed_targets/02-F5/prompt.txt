Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <libdwarf.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" {
#include <libdwarf.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  Dwfl_Thread *thread = dwfl_thread_init(NULL, NULL, 0);
  if (thread == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  int callback(Dwfl_Module *mod, Dwfl_Func *func, void *arg) {
    (void)mod;
    (void)func;
    (void)arg;
    return 0;
  };

  dwfl_thread_getframes(thread, callback, NULL);

  dwfl_thread_destroy(thread);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code:

1. Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include <libdwarf.h>` line to ensure that the `libdwarf.h` header is included in C linkage, which is required for the object linking to succeed.

2. Removed the `extern "C"` declaration before the `int callback` function definition. This is because the `callback` function is defined within the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function, which is already declared with `extern "C"`, so the nested `callback` function does not need an additional `extern "C"` declaration.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
