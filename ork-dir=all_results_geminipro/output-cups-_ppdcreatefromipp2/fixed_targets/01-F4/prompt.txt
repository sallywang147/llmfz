Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>
#include <cups/ppd.h>
#include <cups/ipp.h>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  if (Size < 1 || Size > 10240) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider data(Data, Size);

  size_t bufsize = data.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(1, 10240);
  char *buffer = new char[bufsize];
  memset(buffer, 0, bufsize);

  struct _ipp_s *supported = ippNew();
  struct cups_lang_s *lang = cupsLangDefault();

  char *result = _ppdCreateFromIPP2(buffer, bufsize, supported, lang);

  if (result) {
    delete[] result;
  }

  delete[] buffer;
  ippDelete(supported);

  return 0;
}
```

The fixed code includes the necessary header file `cups/ipp.h` to resolve the undefined reference to `ippNew`. The `extern "C" {}` block is not needed in this case since the code does not contain any C++-specific features that require name mangling.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
