Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <cups/cups.h>
#include <cups/ipp.h>
#include <cups/ppd.h>
#include <cups/string.h>

#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <cups/ppd.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t buffer_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      100, 100000);
  char* buffer = new char[buffer_size];
  memset(buffer, 0, buffer_size);
  const size_t supported_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      100, 100000);
  char* supported = new char[supported_size];
  memset(supported, 0, supported_size);
  const size_t lang_size = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      100, 100000);
  char* lang = new char[lang_size];
  memset(lang, 0, lang_size);
  char* result = _ppdCreateFromIPP2(buffer, buffer_size,
                                     (ipp_t*)supported, (cups_lang_t*)lang);
  free(buffer);
  free(supported);
  free(lang);
  free(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The build issues are caused by the following:

1. The `cups` library is not properly linked. To fix this, the `-lcups` flag should be added to the linker command.
2. The `_ppdCreateFromIPP2` function is not declared in the `cups` library. To fix this, the `ppd.h` header file should be included with `extern "C"`.
3. The `free` function is not declared in the `cups` library. To fix this, the `stdlib.h` header file should be included.

The corrected code includes the necessary header files and linker flags to fix these issues.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
