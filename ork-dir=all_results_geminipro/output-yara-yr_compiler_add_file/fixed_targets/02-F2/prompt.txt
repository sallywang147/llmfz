Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

#include "yacc.h"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  YR_COMPILER* compiler = yr_compiler_new();
  if (compiler == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }

  const std::string rules_file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  FILE* rules_file = fopen(rules_file_name.c_str(), "r");
  if (rules_file == nullptr) {
    yr_compiler_delete(compiler);
    return 0;
  }

  const std::string namespace_ = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();

  int result = yr_compiler_add_file(compiler, rules_file,
                                    const_cast<char*>(namespace_.c_str()),
                                    const_cast<char*>(file_name.c_str()));
  yr_compiler_delete(compiler);
  fclose(rules_file);
  return result;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `yacc.h` header is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause issues when linking the object file with the rest of the program.
2. The `yr_compiler_new()`, `yr_compiler_delete()`, and `yr_compiler_add_file()` functions are not declared in any header file. This can cause the linker to complain about undefined references.

The fixed code wraps the `yacc.h` header with `extern "C" {}` and includes the necessary header files to declare the missing functions.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
