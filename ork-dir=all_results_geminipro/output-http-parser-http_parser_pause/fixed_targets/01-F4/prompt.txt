Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "http_parser.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern "C" {
#include <http_parser.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  static const http_parser_settings settings_null = {.on_message_begin = 0, .on_header_field = 0, .on_header_value = 0, .on_url = 0, .on_status = 0, .on_body = 0, .on_headers_complete = 0, .on_message_complete = 0, .on_chunk_header = 0, .on_chunk_complete = 0};

  http_parser parser;
  http_parser_init(&parser, HTTP_BOTH);
  http_parser_execute(&parser, &settings_null, (const char *)data, size);
  http_parser_pause(&parser, 1);

  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a type mismatch in the `http_parser_execute` function call. The `data` parameter was declared as `uint8_t *`, but the function expects a `const char *`. This mismatch caused the build error.

To fix the issue, the `(char *)` cast was added to the `data` parameter in the `http_parser_execute` function call. This cast converts the `uint8_t *` pointer to a `char *` pointer, which is what the function expects.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
