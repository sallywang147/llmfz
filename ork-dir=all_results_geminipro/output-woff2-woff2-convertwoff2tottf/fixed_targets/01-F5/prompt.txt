Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <woff2/decode.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t data_size) {
  std::string output(std::min(woff2::ComputeWOFF2FinalSize(data, data_size), woff2::kDefaultMaxSize), 0);
  woff2::WOFF2StringOut out(&output);
  woff2::ConvertWOFF2ToTTF(data, data_size, &out);
  return 0;
}
```

The code is missing the necessary header files for the `woff2` library. To fix this, add the following lines at the beginning of the file:

```c++
#include <woff2/woff2_dec.h>
#include <woff2/woff2_enc.h>
```

This will include the necessary header files for the `woff2` library and allow the code to compile successfully.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
