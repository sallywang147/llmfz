```

The following changes were made to the code:

- Added `extern "C" {}` around the `#include` directive for `cctz/civil_time.h` and `cctz/time_zone.h`. This is necessary because these headers contain C++ code that needs to be compiled as C code in order to link with the rest of the program.
- Changed `load_time_zone` to `cctz::load_time_zone`. This is because `load_time_zone` is a function in the `cctz` namespace, and it needs to be called using the namespace qualifier.
- Changed `prev_transition` to `lax.prev_transition`. This is because `prev_transition` is a member function of the `cctz::time_zone` class, and it needs to be called on an instance of that class.

With these changes, the code should now compile and run without errors.
