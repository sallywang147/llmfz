Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include "cctz/civil_time.h"
#include "cctz/time_zone.h"
#include "cctz/time_zone_registry.h"

extern "C" {
#include "cctz/time_zone_registry.h"
int load_time_zone(const std::string& name, cctz::time_zone* tz);
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

  std::string tz = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  cctz::time_zone lax;
  if (load_time_zone(tz, &lax)) {
    std::chrono::system_clock::time_point tp;
    cctz::time_zone::civil_transition trans;
    lax.prev_transition(&tp, &trans);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The main issue with the original code is that the `cctz::time_zone lax` declaration is placed before the `load_time_zone` function call. This means that the `lax` variable is uninitialized when the `load_time_zone` function is called, which can lead to undefined behavior.

To fix this, the declaration of `lax` has been moved after the `load_time_zone` function call, so that `lax` is initialized before it is used.

Additionally, the `extern "C"` directive has been added to the `#include` directive for the `cctz/time_zone_registry.h` header file. This is necessary because the `load_time_zone` function is declared in this header file, and the `extern "C"` directive is required for C++ to properly link to C functions.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
