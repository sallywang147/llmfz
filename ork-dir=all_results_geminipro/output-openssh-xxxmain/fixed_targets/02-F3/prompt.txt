Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" int xxxmain(int argc, char** argv);

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const size_t argc = stream.ConsumeIntegral<size_t>();
  std::vector<std::string> args;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    args.push_back(stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString());
  }

  char** argv = new char*[argc + 1];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    argv[i] = new char[args[i].size() + 1];
    strcpy(argv[i], args[i].c_str());
  }
  argv[argc] = nullptr;

  int ret = xxxmain(argc, argv);

  for (size_t i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    delete[] argv[i];
  }
  delete[] argv;

  return ret;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

* The definition of `xxxmain` is missing.
* The `#include` directive for `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h` is missing.

The fixed code includes the necessary header file and adds the definition of `xxxmain`.

Here is a breakdown of the changes:

* Added `#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>` to include the necessary header file.
* Added `extern "C" int xxxmain(int argc, char** argv);` to define the `xxxmain` function.

With these changes, the code should now build and run without errors.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
