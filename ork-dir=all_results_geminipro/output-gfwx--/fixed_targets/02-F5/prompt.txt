Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

extern "C" {
#include <cstdint>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  std::vector<std::string> vec;
  try {
    vec = stream.ConsumeVector<std::string>();
  } catch (FuzzedDataProvider::ConsumeError &e) {
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code had a missing `return 0;` statement in the catch block of the `try-catch` statement. This caused the compiler to generate an error message indicating that the function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` was not returning a value.

The corrected code adds the missing `return 0;` statement, ensuring that the function returns a value in all cases. This resolves the compiler error and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
