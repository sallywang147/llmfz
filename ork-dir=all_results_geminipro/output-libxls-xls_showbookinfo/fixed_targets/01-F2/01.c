#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_buffer(Data, Size, NULL, NULL);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_showBookInfo(work_book);
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `stdlib.h` is missing. This header is needed for the `free` function, which is used in the `xls_close_WB` function.
2. The `xls_close_WB` function is missing. This function is needed to close the workbook after it has been opened.

The fixed code includes the missing header and function. It also includes the `extern "C"` directive around the `#include` directives for the C standard library headers. This is necessary because the C++ compiler uses a different name mangling scheme than the C compiler. Without the `extern "C"` directive, the linker would not be able to find the symbols defined in the C standard library headers.
