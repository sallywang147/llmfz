Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_buffer(Data, Size, NULL, NULL);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_showBookInfo(work_book);
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

* The `xls.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This can cause linker errors when trying to link the object file with the main program.
* The `xls_open_buffer`, `xls_showBookInfo`, and `xls_close_WB` functions are not declared in the `xls.h` header file. This can cause compiler errors when trying to use these functions.

To fix these issues, the `xls.h` header file should be wrapped with `extern "C" {}` and the necessary function declarations should be added to the header file.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* Function declarations for xls_open_buffer, xls_showBookInfo, and xls_close_WB */
xlsWorkBook *xls_open_buffer(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size, void *pMem,
                             void *pUserData);
void xls_showBookInfo(xlsWorkBook *work_book);
void xls_close_WB(xlsWorkBook *work_book);
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_buffer(Data, Size, NULL, NULL);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_showBookInfo(work_book);
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
