The original code has a build error because the header file `xls.h` is included twice. This is not allowed in C++, as it can lead to multiple definitions of the same symbols. To fix this, the second inclusion of `xls.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This tells the compiler that the symbols in this header file should be treated as C symbols, not C++ symbols. This allows the header file to be included multiple times without causing a build error.
