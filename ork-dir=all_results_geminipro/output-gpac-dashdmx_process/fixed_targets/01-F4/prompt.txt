Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <gpac/constants.h>
#include <gpac/filters.h>

extern "C" {
#include <dashdmx/dashdmx.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  GF_Err e;
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp)
    return 0;
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  GF_FilterSession *fs = gf_fs_new_defaults(0);
  GF_Filter *src = gf_fs_load_source(fs, filename, NULL, NULL, &e);
  GF_Filter *insp = gf_fs_load_filter(fs, "inspect:deep:analyze=bs", &e);
  GF_Filter *demux = gf_fs_load_filter(fs, "demux:dash", &e);
  gf_fs_run(fs);
  dashdmx_process(demux);
  gf_fs_del(fs);

  unlink(filename);
  return 0;
}
```

The error message is:
```
error: undefined reference to 'gf_fs_new_defaults'
error: undefined reference to 'gf_fs_load_source'
error: undefined reference to 'gf_fs_load_filter'
error: undefined reference to 'gf_fs_run'
error: undefined reference to 'gf_fs_del'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definitions of these functions. To fix this, we need to make sure that the linker is aware of the libraries that contain these definitions.

In this case, the libraries are `libgpac` and `libdashdmx`. We can add these libraries to the linker command line using the `-l` flag. For example, if we are using the GNU linker, we would add the following flags to the linker command line:

```
-lgpac -ldashdmx
```

Alternatively, we can use the `pkg-config` tool to automatically add the necessary linker flags. For example, if we have `pkg-config` installed, we can add the following line to the top of our source file:

```
#include <pkg-config.h>
```

And then add the following line to the linker command line:

```
$(pkg-config --libs gpac dashdmx)
```

This will automatically add the necessary linker flags for the `libgpac` and `libdashdmx` libraries.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
