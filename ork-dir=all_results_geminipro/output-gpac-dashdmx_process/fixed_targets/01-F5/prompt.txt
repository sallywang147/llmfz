Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <gpac/constants.h>
#include <gpac/filters.h>

extern "C" {
#include <dashdmx/dashdmx.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char filename[256];
  GF_Err e;
  sprintf(filename, "/tmp/libfuzzer.%d", getpid());

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "wb");
  if (!fp)
    return 0;
  fwrite(data, size, 1, fp);
  fclose(fp);

  GF_FilterSession *fs = gf_fs_new_defaults(0);
  GF_Filter *src = gf_fs_load_source(fs, filename, NULL, NULL, &e);
  GF_Filter *insp = gf_fs_load_filter(fs, "inspect:deep:analyze=bs", &e);
  GF_Filter *demux = gf_fs_load_filter(fs, "demux:dash", &e);
  gf_fs_run(fs);
  dashdmx_process(demux);
  gf_fs_del(fs);

  unlink(filename);
  return 0;
}
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The `pkg-config` library was included to automatically add the necessary linker flags for the `libgpac` and `libdashdmx` libraries.
* The `extern "C" {}` block was added around the `#include <dashdmx/dashdmx.h>` line to ensure that the linker can find the definitions of the functions in the `libdashdmx` library.

With these changes, the code should now build and run successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
