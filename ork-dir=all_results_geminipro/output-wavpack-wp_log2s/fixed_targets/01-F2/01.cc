#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "wp_log2s.h"  // Include the header file that defines wp_log2s

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int value = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  wp_log2s(value);  // Call the wp_log2s function
  return 0;
}
```

This code should compile and run without errors. The issue was that the header file `wp_log2s.h` was not included, which prevented the compiler from finding the definition of the `wp_log2s` function. By including the header file, the compiler can now find the function definition and the code will compile successfully.
