Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The code is trying to call the function `wp_log2s`, but this function is not defined anywhere in the code. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that contains the definition of `wp_log2s`.

The corrected code:

```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "wp_log2s.h"  // Include the header file that defines wp_log2s

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const int value = stream.ConsumeIntegral<int>();
  wp_log2s(value);  // Call the wp_log2s function
  return 0;
}
```

With this change, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
