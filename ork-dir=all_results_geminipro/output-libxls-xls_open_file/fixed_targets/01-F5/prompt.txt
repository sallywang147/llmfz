Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdint.h>
}

XLS_ERROR LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  XLS_ERROR outError;
  xls_open_file((char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  return outError;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `xls.h` header file is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This is necessary because the `xls.h` header file contains C++ declarations, which are not compatible with C code.

2. The `xls_open_file` function is not declared in the `xls.h` header file. This means that the compiler does not know what the function signature is, and it will generate an error.

To fix these issues, we can wrap the `xls.h` header file with `extern "C" {}` and add a declaration for the `xls_open_file` function to the `xls.h` header file.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include "xls.h"

extern "C" {
#include <stdint.h>

XLS_ERROR xls_open_file(char *filename, char *mode, XLS_ERROR *error);
}

XLS_ERROR LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  XLS_ERROR outError;
  xls_open_file((char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  return outError;
}
```

With these changes, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
