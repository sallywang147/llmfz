Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <xls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int outError;
  struct xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_file((char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The header `xls.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to not find the definition of the `xls_open_file` and `xls_close_WB` functions.

To fix this, we need to wrap the `xls.h` header with `extern "C" {}`.

2. The `xls_open_file` and `xls_close_WB` functions are declared as `int xls_open_file(...)` and `int xls_close_WB(...)`, respectively. However, the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function expects them to be declared as `int xls_open_file(const char *, void *, int *)` and `int xls_close_WB(struct xlsWorkBook *)`, respectively.

To fix this, we need to change the declaration of the `xls_open_file` and `xls_close_WB` functions in the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function to match their actual declarations.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <xls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int outError;
  struct xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_file((const char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
