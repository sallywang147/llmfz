The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'xls_open_file'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `xls_open_file`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library that contains this function is linked with our program.

In this case, the library is called `libxls`. To link with this library, we need to add the following line to our code:

```
#include <xls.h>
```

This will tell the linker to look for the `libxls` library when it is linking our program.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <xls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int outError;
  struct xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_file((const char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Now, the code should compile and run without errors.
