#include <xls.h>

extern "C" {

}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int outError;
  struct xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_file((const char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The original code was missing the necessary header file `xls.h` which contains the declaration of the function `xls_open_file`. Adding this header file resolves the build error.

The corrected code is shown above. It includes the necessary header file and correctly calls the `xls_open_file` function.
