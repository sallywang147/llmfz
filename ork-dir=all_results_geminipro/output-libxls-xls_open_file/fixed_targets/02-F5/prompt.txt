Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
The error message is:

```
error: undefined reference to 'xls_open_file'
```

This means that the linker cannot find the definition of the function `xls_open_file`. To fix this, we need to make sure that the library that contains this function is linked with our program.

In this case, the library is called `libxls`. To link with this library, we need to add the following line to our code:

```
#include <xls.h>
```

This will tell the linker to look for the `libxls` library when it is linking our program.

The corrected code is shown below:

```c++
#include <xls.h>

extern "C" {
#include <stddef.h>
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  int outError;
  struct xlsWorkBook *work_book = xls_open_file((const char *)Data, NULL, &outError);
  if (work_book) {
    xls_close_WB(work_book);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Now, the code should compile and run without errors.
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
<solution>
