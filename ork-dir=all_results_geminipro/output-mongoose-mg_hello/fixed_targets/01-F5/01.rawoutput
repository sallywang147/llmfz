```c++
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <mongoose.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_hello(const_cast<char*>(url.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mg_hello` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but the definition is not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the compiler cannot find the definition of `mg_hello`.
2. The `mg_hello` function expects a `char*` argument, but the `url` variable is a `std::string`. This causes a compiler error because the types are incompatible.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The `mg_hello` function definition has been wrapped in `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `url` variable has been converted to a `char*` using the `c_str()` method.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.
