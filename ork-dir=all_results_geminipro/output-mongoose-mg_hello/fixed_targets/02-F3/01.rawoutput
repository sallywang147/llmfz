```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_hello(const_cast<char*>(url.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```
The original code has the following issues:
1. The `mg_hello` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but the `#include` directive for `mongoose.h` is not wrapped with `extern "C" {}`. This causes the linker to be unable to find the definition of `mg_hello`.
2. The `mg_hello` function takes a `char*` argument, but the `url` variable is a `std::string`. This causes a compiler error.

To fix the code, we need to:
1. Wrap the `#include` directive for `mongoose.h` with `extern "C" {}`.
2. Cast the `url` variable to a `char*` before passing it to `mg_hello`.

The corrected code is shown above.
