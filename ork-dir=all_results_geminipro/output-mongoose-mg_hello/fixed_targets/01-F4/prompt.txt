Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include <mongoose.h>
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_hello(const_cast<char*>(url.c_str()));
  return 0;
}
```

The original code has the following issues:

1. The `mg_hello` function is declared as `extern "C"`, but the definition is not wrapped in `extern "C" {}`. This causes a linker error because the compiler cannot find the definition of `mg_hello`.
2. The `mg_hello` function expects a `char*` argument, but the `url` variable is a `std::string`. This causes a compiler error because the types are incompatible.

To fix these issues, the code has been modified as follows:

1. The `mg_hello` function definition has been wrapped in `extern "C" {}`.
2. The `url` variable has been converted to a `char*` using the `c_str()` method.

With these changes, the code should compile and run correctly.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
