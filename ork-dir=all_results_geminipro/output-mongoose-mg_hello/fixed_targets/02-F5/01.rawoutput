```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

extern "C" {
#include "mongoose.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  const std::string url = stream.ConsumeRemainingBytesAsString();
  mg_hello(url.c_str());  // Remove the const_cast
  return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `mg_hello` function takes a non-const pointer to a character array as its argument, but the code was passing a `const char*` to it. This caused a compiler error.

To fix the issue, the `const_cast` operator was removed from the line where `mg_hello` is called. This operator is used to cast away the constness of a pointer, but it is not necessary in this case because the `mg_hello` function does not modify the string that is passed to it.
