Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

// Include the necessary header for `fxRunFileThread`
#include "fx_api.h"

extern "C" {
#include "fx_api.h"
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider provider(data, size);
  const size_t input_size = provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<size_t>(
      0,
      provider.remaining_bytes());
  auto input = provider.ConsumeBytes<char>(input_size);
  char* output = fxRunFileThread(input.data());
  free(output);
  return 0;
}
```

In this fixed code:

1. The necessary header for `fxRunFileThread` is included.
2. The `#include` directive for `fx_api.h` is wrapped with `extern "C" {}` to ensure proper linking.

This resolves the build issues and allows the code to compile successfully.

The code has the following build issues:
<error>

</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
