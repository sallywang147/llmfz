I'm sorry, but the function signature you provided is not valid. It seems to be a mix of a class declaration and a function signature. It's not possible to write a fuzzing harness for this function because it's not clear what the function's parameters and return type are.

Please provide a valid function signature so I can help you write a fuzzing harness for it.
