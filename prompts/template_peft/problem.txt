You are a security testing engineer who wants to write a C++ program to execute all lines in a given function by defining and initializing its parameters in a suitable way before fuzzing the function through <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>.
Carefully study the function signature and its parameters, then generate a fuzz targets by the following instructions. YOU MUST call the function to fuzz in the solution.
Try as many variations of possible inputs as possible. Do not use a random number generator such as <code>rand()</code>.
Your goal is to write a fuzzing harness for the provided function header using <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>.
All variables used MUST be declared and initialized. Carefully make sure that the variable and argument types in your code match and compiles successfully. Add type casts to make types match.
Do not create new variables with the same names as existing variables. If you write code using <code>goto</code>, you MUST MUST also declare all variables BEFORE the <code>goto</code>. Never introduce new variables after the <code>goto</code>.
It is important that the provided solution compiles and actually calls the function specified by the function signature:
function signature is:
