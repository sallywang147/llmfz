Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
#include <fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

class const {
 public:
  double operator()(double d) {
    return d;
  }
};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  double d = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint<double>();
  const c;
  c(d);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
../../src/harfbuzz/test/fuzzing/hb-repacker-fuzzer.cc:7:1: error: declaration of anonymous class must be a definition
class const {
^
../../src/harfbuzz/test/fuzzing/hb-repacker-fuzzer.cc:17:9: error: C++ requires a type specifier for all declarations
  const c;
  ~~~~~ ^
2 errors generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
