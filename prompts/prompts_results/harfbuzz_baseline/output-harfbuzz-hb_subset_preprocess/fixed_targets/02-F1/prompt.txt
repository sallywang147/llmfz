Given the following C++ program and its build error message, fix the code to achieve the original functionality.

If a function is missing, fix it by including the related libraries.

If the error contains "undefined reference to", this means one or more of the header <code>#include</code> directives need to be wrapped with <code>extern "C" {}</code> for the object linking to succeed. You must fix this by rewriting the relevant <code>#include</code> and wrapping it with <code>extern "C" {}</code>.

Below is the code needs to be built:
<code>
 #include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <hb-ot.h>

#include "hb-fuzzer.hh"

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  alloc_state = _fuzzing_alloc_state(data, size);

  hb_blob_t *blob = hb_blob_create((const char *)data, size, HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY, nullptr, nullptr);
  hb_face_t *face = hb_face_create(blob, 0);

  hb_face_t *new_face = hb_subset_preprocess(face);
  hb_face_destroy(new_face);

  hb_face_destroy(face);
  hb_blob_destroy(blob);
  return 0;
}
</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
../../src/harfbuzz/test/fuzzing/hb-repacker-fuzzer.cc:14:25: error: use of undeclared identifier 'hb_subset_preprocess'
  hb_face_t *new_face = hb_subset_preprocess(face);
                        ^
1 error generated.
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It's important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
